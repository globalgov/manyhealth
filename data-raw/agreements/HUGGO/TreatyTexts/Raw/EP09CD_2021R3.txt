World health statistics 2020: monitoring health for the SDGs. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2020 (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/332070). 4. WHO’s World health statistics 2020 reveal that, compared with the advances against communicable diseases, progress in preventing and controlling premature death from NCDs has been inadequate. 5. An estimated 41 million people worldwide died of NCDs in 2016, equivalent to 71% of all deaths. Four NCDs caused most of those deaths: cardiovascular diseases (17.9 million), cancer (9.0 million), chronic respiratory diseases (3.8 million), and diabetes (1.6 million). 6. An estimated 15 million people worldwide died of NCDs between the ages of 30 and 70 years, defined as premature death. The probability (risk) of premature death from any one of the four main NCDs decreased by 18% globally between 2000 and 2016. The most rapid decline was seen for chronic respiratory diseases (40% lower), followed by cardiovascular diseases and cancer (both 19% lower). Diabetes, however, showed a 5% increase in premature mortality during the same period. 7. Despite the rapid progress made between 2000 and 2010 in reducing the risk of premature death from any one of the four main NCDs, the momentum of change has dwindled during 2010–2016, with annual reductions in premature mortality rates slowing for the main NCDs. In high-income countries, even though the premature mortality rate due to diabetes decreased from 2000 to 2010, it increased in 2010–2016. In low- and middle-income countries, the premature mortality rate due to diabetes increased across both periods. 8. The rising mortality rates from diabetes are associated with – among other factors – the increasing prevalence of obesity. Since 2000, the prevalence of obesity among adults (18 years and older) globally has increased 1.5 times and the prevalence in children (5–18 years) more than doubled (from 2.9% to 6.8%) in 2016. 9. In 2016, the prevalence of physical inactivity for adults aged 18 years or more was 27.5%. Levels of inactivity are twice as high in high-income countries as in low-income countries, and insufficient activity increased by 5% in high-income countries between 2001 and 2016. 10. Global prevalence of hypertension decreased by 11% from 2000 to 2015. The prevalence of hypertension was highest in low-income countries (28.4%) and lowest in high-income countries (17.7%) in 2015. 11. Tobacco use has decreased steadily globally. A little under one quarter (23.6%) of adults (15 years and older) globally used tobacco in some form in 2018, down from one third (33.3%) in 2000. The total number of adult tobacco users remains very high, however: about 1.3 billion in 2018. 12. The burden of mental health conditions remains high. According to the latest global burden of disease estimates (for 2017), mental, neurological and substance use disorders make up 11.1% of disability-adjusted life years lost worldwide and 26.7% of years lived with disability (compared to 10.2% and 26.8% respectively in 2012), and an estimated 971 million people have a mental disorder (compared to 916 million people in 2012). Almost 800 000 people die by suicide each year; it is the second leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds. 13. Worldwide, alcohol consumption, measured in litres of pure alcohol per person of 15 years or older, has been relatively stable since 2010 and was estimated at 6.2 litres in 2018. However, trends observed and projections made before the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) forecast an increase in global alcohol consumption per capita by 2025. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the levels of alcohol consumption worldwide and predicted trends still needs to be assessed. 14. In 2016, nine out of 10 people breathed air that did not meet the WHO air quality guidelines and more than half the world’s population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times above the safety standard set by WHO. Although the proportion of the global population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies has increased steadily since 2000 and reached 63% in 2018, the actual number of people without clean cooking has remained relatively constant over the past three decades. PROGRESS TOWARDS TARGET 3.4 OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL AND RELATED TARGETS: WHERE WE STAND TODAY 15. Target 3.4 of Sustainable Development Goal 3 is to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by a third by 2030 relative to 2015 levels, and to promote mental health and well-being. Only 17 countries are on track to meet that target for women and 15 for men.1 There is some reduction in the global 1 NCD Countdown 2030 Collaborators.

The Lancet, 2020; 396(10255):918-934 (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31761-X/fulltext, accessed 29 October 2020). age-standardized suicide rate1 (8% reduction from 2010 to 2016)2 but the indicator (3.4.2) shows that the suicide rate is still far from achieving the target. 16. Target 3.8 is to achieve universal health coverage. All income categories of countries have demonstrated almost no progress since 2000 in expanding the “universal health coverage service capacity and access coverage” for the prevention, screening, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of NCDs.3 In particular, between 2010 and 2019, many countries showed lagging performance on effective coverage indicators for NCDs compared with those for communicable diseases and maternal and child health, suggesting that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising NCD burden. There is a growing awareness that global ambitions to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage are increasingly unlikely to be realized without concerted action on NCDs.4 17. Overweight among children has shown a concerning upward trend. Worldwide, an estimated 5.6% – or 38.3 million children under five years of age – were overweight in 2019, compared with about 30.3 million in 2000. 18. Target 3.5 is to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including the harmful use of alcohol, which is a risk factor for NCDs and other health conditions. Since 2010 little progress has been made in reducing the harmful use of alcohol, and development and implementation of effective alcohol control measures have been uneven between countries and WHO regions. 19. Target 3.a is to strengthen the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, where progress is measured by the age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older. WHO estimates that the prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older has declined globally since 2015, from 24.9% in 2015 to 23.6% in 2018.5 However, the implementation progress has been uneven for different articles of the Convention. Only 32 Member States are currently on track to achieve WHO’s voluntary target of a relative reduction in tobacco use prevalence of 30% between 2010 and 2025. 20. Over the past decade, the number of countries monitoring and reporting on air quality (indicator 11.6.2 on annual mean levels of fine particulate matter) has improved. Globally, the population exposed 1 WHO. Mental health atlas 2017.

In 2018, 63% (range 56–68%) of the global population had access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, leaving the global population without such access at 2.8 billion people,2 a figure unchanged for around two decades now (indicator 7.1.2 on proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology). Without prompt action, universal access will fall short of the relevant Goals by almost 30%. 22. In a growing recognition of air pollution as a public health threat, countries are scaling up commitments to implement air quality policies and to align climate and air quality. At the 2019 Climate Action Summit, 50 countries with in total more than one billion people committed themselves to reach WHO air quality guideline values and align climate and air quality policies by 2030. 23. For the poorest one billion people of the world, NCDs account for more than a third of their burden of disease. That includes almost 800 000 deaths annually among those aged younger than 40 years, more than HIV, tuberculosis and maternal deaths combined. 1 Shaddick G, Thomas ML, Mudu P, Ruggeri G, Gumy S.

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2020 (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/334136). THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A DEADLY INTERPLAY WITH THE NCD EPIDEMIC 24. In May 2020, WHO conducted a rapid assessment survey of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NCD resources and services,3 to which 163 Member States (84%) responded. In 122 countries, governments are collecting or collating data on comorbidities between persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 and persons living with NCDs. The Secretariat is analysing the data in order to derive global estimates on these comorbidities. Initial results seem to indicate that persons living with hypertension and/or diabetes appear to be two-to-four times more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with or die from the virus. People living with obesity or using tobacco may be suffering from undiagnosed or untreated hypertension or diabetes, which may be one of the reasons for a differential social impact of COVID-19 within countries. 25. More than 80 countries reported complete or partial disruptions to management services for people with hypertension or diabetes and diabetic complications. Countries most commonly reported that they used triaging in response to the disruptions to NCD-related services; telemedicine was also very widely used. However, the disruption of health services is particularly problematic for those living with NCDs who need regular care. 26. Several examples from countries show how the disruption of NCD services has directly affected people. Screening, case identification and referral systems for cancer have all been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a substantial decrease in cancer diagnoses. The fact that fewer patients with acute coronary syndrome are admitted to hospital often means increases in out-of-hospital deaths and long-term complications of myocardial infarction. The Secretariat is conducting a modelling exercise to forecast the long-term upsurge in premature deaths from NCDs resulting from the disruption of health services. 27. WHO’s interim operational guidance on maintaining health services in the COVID-19 context includes considerations for NCDs, mental health and nutrition.1 The joint policy brief on responding to NCDs during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic provides examples of NCD-specific actions that could be considered in the development of national COVID-19 response and recovery plans.2 28. In September 2020, the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution 74/306 on a comprehensive and coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic called upon Member States “to further strengthen efforts to address non-communicable diseases as part of universal health coverage, recognizing that people living with non-communicable diseases are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and are among the most impacted by the pandemic”.3 1 WHO.

The COVID.19 pandemic is profoundly affecting mental health and well-being. Mental and neurological manifestations, such as depression, anxiety and delirium/encephalopathy, are reported in COVID-19 patients. Many people with pre-existing mental, neurological and substance use disorders are facing exacerbation of symptoms due to stressors, while the limited available services are disrupted. Some people cope with stressors in harmful ways such as turning to alcohol, drugs or risky patterns of potentially addictive behaviours, including video gaming and gambling. Adversity is a potent risk factor for mental and behavioural disorders, such as depression and alcohol use disorders. 30. The Secretariat has assessed the impact of COVID-19 on services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders through a rapid survey between June and August 2020.4 Out of 130 countries, 121 (93%) countries reported disruptions in one or more of their services for these disorders and 116 (89%) reported that mental health and psychosocial support was part of their national COVID-19 response plans. Countries are responding to the disruptions through teletherapy interventions (70%), crisis hotlines (68%) and training for health-care providers (60%). The General Assembly resolution 74/306 encouraged Member States “to address mental health in their response to and recovery from the pandemic by ensuring widespread availability of emergency mental health and psychosocial support”. 31. The Secretariat is coordinating different pillars of its COVID.19 response to integrate mental health and psychosocial support into the COVID.19 response effort.5 WHO co.chairs the Inter.Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings. A wide range of resources, available in numerous languages and formats, has been developed by WHO and its partners.1 WHO established the Global Forum on Neurology and COVID-19 in order to exchange knowledge and enhance clinical practices. 1 WHO.

Over the past 20 years, NCDs have changed the world. They have become the leading cause of death in most countries, resulting in 200 million premature deaths among people aged between 30 and 70 years, most living in low- and middle-income countries. During the next 10 years, another 150 million people will die from NCDs between the ages of 30 and 70 years. Most deaths can be avoided or delayed. 33. In adopting resolution WHA53.17 in 2000, the Health Assembly recognized for the first time that the long-term needs of people living with NCDs are rarely dealt with. Accordingly, the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases in 2011 included a commitment from governments to explore the provision of adequate resources through, inter alia, domestic and bilateral channels. In 2016, NCDs represented 27% of domestic public spending and 9% of external funds for health across a dataset including 16 low-income countries and 24 middle-income countries.2 Today, NCDs remain the largest, most internationally-underfunded public health issue globally, where most lives could be saved or improved. 34. Bilateral donors have not shown increased appetite for funding activities specifically earmarked as addressing NCDs to establish even the minimal critical capacity, mechanisms and mandates needed in low- and middle-income countries to pursue change. In the absence of such funding, groups with economic, market and commercial interests stepped up their efforts to lobby against implementation of interventions by WHO, discrediting WHO’s scientific knowledge, available evidence and reviews of international experience, and bringing legal challenges against countries to oppose progress.3 35. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic must address precisely these failures that are being exposed and exploited by the pandemic. Investment in the prevention and control of NCDs as part of COVID-19 recovery is attractive, as cost-effective, high-impact interventions already exist but are not sufficiently implemented and scaled up in low- and middle-income countries. Tackling NCDs in general must be an integral part of the immediate response to COVID-19 and of the recovery at global, regional and national levels, as well as part of the strategies to build back better. 36. Pathway analyses show that every country still has options today for achieving target 3.4 of Sustainable Development Goal 3. No country could achieve the target by addressing only prevention or only counselling, screening, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of NCDs. 37. The final report of WHO’s Independent High-level Commission on Non-communicable Diseases1 recommended a specific set of the most effective and feasible interventions that should be considered as a priority to accelerate progress towards target 3.4, reducing premature mortality from NCDs by one third (Table 4). 1 WHO.

The report of the WHO/The Lancet’s NCD Countdown 2030 in 2020 showed that essential components of any strategy to achieve target 3.4 of Goal 3 must include control of tobacco use and of the harmful use of alcohol, detection and treatment of hypertension and diabetes, primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in high-risk individuals through multidrug treatment, and bronchodilators and low-dose inhaled corticosteroids for asthma and selected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.4 39. Progress in noncommunicable diseases towards relevant targets needs a major boost. The Secretariat is scaling up its programme on NCDs. The immediate aim is to catalyse tangible progress towards target 3.4 within the next three years, especially through new and bold innovative solutions that have a multiplier effect across the Sustainable Development Goals. 40. A major contribution to attaining target 3.4 will come from WHO’s new initiative to eliminate cervical cancer in the next 100 years and reaching the 90-70-90 triple-intervention target by 2030: • 90% of girls fully vaccinated against human papillomavirus by the age of 15 years; • 70% of women screened using a high-performance test by the age of 35 years and again by the age of 45 years; • 90% of women identified with cervical disease receive treatment (90% of women with pre-cancer treated and 90% of women with invasive cancer managed). 41. The Secretariat will develop similar strategic cross-cutting initiatives for diabetes, childhood cancer and breast cancer. 42. The current capacities for NCD surveillance remain inadequate in many countries and urgently require strengthening. Currently, many countries have few usable mortality data and weak information on risk factor exposure and morbidity. Data on NCDs are often not well integrated into national health information systems. Improving country-level surveillance and monitoring remains a top priority in the fight against NCDs. The Secretariat will continue to support the scaling up of national efforts to strengthen NCD surveillance and data systems, and expand the provision of strategic information for policy-making, service provision and accountability. 43. Other organizations in the United Nations system are also committed to aligning their relevant activities with the comprehensive United Nations response to COVID-19, for example through: (i) raising national awareness on the return on investment in NCD prevention and treatment so as to secure domestic budgetary allocations and international finance; (ii) supporting countries in including NCDs into their socioeconomic plans for the COVID-19 response; and (iii) participating in the WHO Working Group on COVID-19 and NCDs. The United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All continue to provide important platforms for many United Nations organizations to work through. PREPARATORY PROCESS LEADING TO THE FOURTH HIGH-LEVEL MEETING OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF NCDs IN 2025 44.

In accordance with paragraph 60 of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, in 2019 the Secretariat convened a representative group of stakeholders, including Member States and international partners, to conduct a mid-point evaluation of implementation of the global action plan. Its purpose was to assess progress towards the six objectives of the global action plan and identify the lessons learned throughout its implementation by Member States, by international partners and by the three levels of the Organization. The evaluation aimed to document successes and identify challenges and gaps in the implementation of the global action plan since 2013; to make strategic recommendations for improving implementation up until 2030; and to provide inputs into WHO’s next global status report on noncommunicable diseases and other relevant reports. The Secretariat’s Evaluation Office will submit an executive summary of the mid-point evaluation to the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, through the Executive Board (see document EB148/7 Add.1). 46. As specified in the terms of reference for the Global coordination mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases,1 a final evaluation of the mechanism took place in 2020 in order to assess its effectiveness, its added value and its continued relevance to the achievement of the 2025 voluntary global targets, including its possible extension. The Evaluation Office will submit an executive summary of the final evaluation to the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, through the Executive Board (see document EB148/7 Add.2). 47. In line with the terms of reference of the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, the evaluation of its contribution to the implementation of WHO’s Global Action plan was described in the mid-point evaluation of that plan. 1 Document A67/14 Add.1, Appendix 1. ACTION BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD 48. The Board is invited: • to note the report and its annexes; • to provide guidance on the continued relevance of WHO’s Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and on any corrective measures which may be taken where actions have not been effective, and to reorient parts of the plan, as appropriate, in response to the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and/or the United Nations Comprehensive Response to COVID-19, as appropriate; • to provide guidance on the continued relevance of WHO’s Global coordination mechanism for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and the possible extension of its lifespan, taking into account the evaluation mentioned in paragraph 46, and decision WHA72(11) (2019), which extended the lifespan of WHO’s Global action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases 2013–2020 to 2030. 49. The Board is further invited to consider the following draft decision: The Executive Board, having considered the report of the Director-General on the political declaration of the third high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,1 decided to recommend to the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly the adoption of the following decision: 1 Document EB148/7. The Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, having considered the report of the Director-General, decided to adopt the proposed updates to the appendices of WHO’s comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 (contained in document EB148/7, Annex 5, appendices 1 and 2).  ANNEX 1 CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN THE CONTEXT OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH 1. In 2017, the Seventieth World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA70.12 (2017) on cancer prevention and control in the context of an integrated approach and requested the Director-General: to develop, before the end of 2019, the first periodic public health- and policy-oriented world report on cancer; to prepare a comprehensive technical report on pricing approaches and their impact on the availability and affordability of cancer medicines; to develop tool kits to establish and implement comprehensive cancer prevention and control programmes; to strengthen the capacity of the Secretariat both to support the implementation of cost-effective interventions and country-adapted models of care and to work with international partners; and to provide technical assistance, including support for the establishment of centres of excellence. This annex describes progress made in implementing the resolution. 2. The Secretariat has undertaken the following activities. 3. WHO report on cancer.1 The report and accompanying cancer country profiles2 were launched on World Cancer Day (4 February 2020), in coordination with the launch by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of its World Cancer Report on cancer research for cancer prevention. The content of both documents was harmonized. 4. The WHO report included an investment case for cancer, in line with the mandate from resolution WHA70.12, that demonstrated every US$ 1 invested in cancer control yields a full social return based on both direct productivity and societal gains of US$ 9.50. By investing US$ 2.70 per person in low-income countries, US$ 3.95 per person in lower-middle-income countries and US$ 8.15 per person in upper-middle-income countries, an additional 7.3 million lives could be saved by 2030. 5. Technical report on cancer medicine pricing approaches. The requested comprehensive technical report on pricing of cancer medicines and its impacts was submitted to and noted by the Executive Board at its 144th session.3 In 2020 WHO updated the WHO guideline on country pharmaceutical pricing policies to support national policy development and implementation.4 6. Toolkit for cancer prevention and control. Among its multiple toolkits to support Member States with cancer policy formulation and guidance, WHO, working with the International Agency for 1 WHO.

It provides evidence on the most cost-effective interventions for all age groups and has been used to support five Member States in implementing cancer interventions. 7. WHO, working with the International Atomic Energy Agency, issues guidance, providing a framework for Member States to establish comprehensive cancer centres. 8. Technical support to countries. The Secretariat has provided broad technical support to Member States in the development and formulation of comprehensive programmes and policies on cancer prevention and control. 9. WHO collaborated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to support countries in enabling radiotherapy procurement by prioritizing radiotherapy technology aligned with health system capacity. Technical specifications for radiotherapy were jointly developed as part of inter-agency guidance on technical specifications for radiotherapy equipment in cancer treatment. 10. WHO has also worked with the International Atomic Energy Agency to increase coordination and support provided to Member States participating in an “imPACT review”. The imPACT methodology has been revised to improve the service and to provide more effective and coordinated support to Member States, including broad partner collaboration. 11. Elimination of cervical cancer. In resolution WHA73.2 (2020), the Seventy-third World Health Assembly adopted the global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. The global strategy outlines the 90-70-90 targets to be reached by 2030, on the basis of human papillomavirus vaccination, screening, and treatment of pre-invasive and invasive cancers, including palliative care. For the third target of the global strategy (the appropriate management of 90% of women identified with invasive cervical cancer), the Secretariat is preparing a framework for strengthening and scaling-up services for the management of invasive cervical cancer. 12. WHO global initiative for childhood cancer. In September 2018, this global initiative was launched. It aims to double the probabilities of survival from childhood cancer, which would save one million more lives by 2030, by improving access to and quality of services including treatment and palliative care. A technical package, CureAll, will be launched in 2021. Support to Member States has started in 12 countries.2 13. Collaboration with stakeholders. The Secretariat has strengthened engagement with broad multisectoral stakeholders within and beyond existing WHO initiatives. This has included enhanced coordination between the International Agency on Cancer Research and WHO at the management and working levels, as reflected in the development of standard operating procedures and routine communication on IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention.3 1 OneHealth Tool.

The Secretariat has strengthened capacity, as requested, by increasing the number of staff working on cancer prevention and control, with more than 20 new staff positions and consultancy posts, equally distributed among all levels of the Organization. The result has been increased intensity and frequency of support to Member States. 15. The Secretariat will continue to support Member States in their efforts to prevent, identify and address cancer prevention and control through integrating cancer care within noncommunicable diseases policies and programmes and broader work to strengthen national health systems as part of universal health coverage. ANNEX 2 GLOBAL STRATEGY ON DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH AND GLOBAL ACTION PLAN ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 2018–2030 1. This annex sets out the progress made in implementing resolutions WHA57.17 (2004) on global strategy on diet, physical activity and health and WHA71.6 (2018) on global action plan on physical activity 2018–2030. GLOBAL STRATEGY ON DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH: PROGRESS TO DATE 2. To support Member States in implementing the set of recommendations on physical activity, the Secretariat produced a series of supporting global technical resources. In addition, regional technical tools and resources supported policy action across key settings and populations. 3. In 2010, WHO launched the first global recommendations on physical activity for health1 outlining the substantial range of health benefits of regular physical activity for different age groups. These guidelines affirmed the substantial health benefits of regular physical activity for healthy growth and development, prevention of leading noncommunicable diseases and injuries, and improvement of mental health and well-being. 4. In 2013, the Health Assembly agreed the first global target to reduce physical inactivity by 10% by 2025 as part of the set of nine voluntary targets to reduce noncommunicable disease by 2025.2 The global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020 had identified public awareness campaigns as a cost-effective intervention (“best buy”), and in 2017 an updated set of best buys identified an extended set of effective interventions3 to increase population levels of physical activity across the life course. 5. In all regions, technical support and multi-country training were developed and capacity-building workshops conducted, resulting in an increasing number of countries developing national policies or plans and surveillance. In addition, countries across all regions commenced, or updated, their surveillance of physical activity in adults and, to a lesser extent, adolescents. 6. Although in all WHO regional offices limited human and financial capacity dedicated to physical activity constrained the pace and scale of technical assistance to countries, the Regional Office for 1 WHO.

In 2016, the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity reaffirmed the importance of addressing physical inactivity in children, especially young children.3 Its subsequent implementation plan4 called for countries to prioritize and strengthen the promotion of physical activity to children through schools and child care, to parents and families, and through supportive urban design and transport systems. 8. Throughout the period 2004–2016, the global strategy contributed to increased recognition globally of the importance of regular physical activity. Overall, however, the impact on the development and implementation of national policy and approaches was slow and uneven, and mostly limited to high-income countries. Rising concerns about the lack of progress in reducing levels of physical inactivity and the apparent widening of disparities prompted the request for a global action plan on physical activity, drawing on the latest scientific evidence on effective approaches and aligned with the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 1 WHO Regional Office for Europe.

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018 (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/275415). GLOBAL ACTION PLAN ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 2018–2030: PROGRESS TO DATE 9. In resolution WHA71.6 (2018), the Seventy-first World Health Assembly endorsed the global action plan on physical activity 2018–2030, which provided an updated set of 20 evidence-based policy recommendations for accelerating progress towards the interim 2025 target, namely a 10% improvement in physical activity. 10. The Health Assembly requested five specific actions: (1) implementation of the actions for the Secretariat in the global action plan, including providing necessary support to Member States for implementation of the plan, in collaboration with other relevant partners; (2) finalization of a monitoring and evaluation framework on the implementation of the global action plan; (3) production of a global status report on physical activity, building on the latest evidence including that on sedentary behaviours; (4) updating the global recommendations on physical activity for health 2010; and (5) reporting on progress made in implementing the global action plan to the Health Assembly in 2021, 2026 and 2030. The following paragraphs respond to that request and outline key priorities for the remainder of the biennium 2020–2021 and challenges and opportunities for promoting physical activity. Responding to requests from Member States to support national efforts for implementing the recommendations of the global action plan 11. In 2018, WHO launched ACTIVE: a technical package on effective interventions to promote physical activity.1 It provides guidance for Member States on how to plan, start and scale up the implementation of the policy recommendations across the four strategic areas of the global action plan, including strengthening governance and national policy frameworks and multisectoral collaboration. 12. Technical support on how to reduce disparities in physical activity between subpopulations will be described in modules on promoting physical activity to older adults, people living with disabilities or chronic disease, and strengthening community sport-health initiatives and partnerships. 13. At the regional level, tools and resources to support Member States’ actions on physical activity and for sharing regional best practices have also been developed in priority areas including: communication campaigns, health-promoting schools, counselling in primary health care, workplaces, healthy ageing, and healthy cities. 14. Training courses have been held to strengthen skills and knowledge on physical activity within context of health promotion and/or NCD prevention programmes at the global, regional and national levels. Often these have been conducted in collaboration with WHO collaborating centres and supported by stakeholders; during 2018–2019 more than 100 countries have participated. 15. New global comparative analyses of levels and trends in physical activity estimated that in 2016 one quarter of adults and three quarters of adolescents did not meet global recommendations, with negligible improvements since 2001.2 Furthermore, gender disparities between men and women, and boys and girls, appeared to be widening. 1 WHO.

In 2019–2020, the Secretariat completed the requested updating of the global recommendations from 2010. The work was supported by a 27-member Guideline Development Group and included a web-based public consultation. 17. WHO’s new guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour3 have been finalized for children and adolescents (aged 5–17 years), adults (18–64 years), older adults (65 years and above) and include, for the first time, specific recommendations on physical activity in subpopulations such as pregnant women and those living with chronic conditions or disability. The guidelines are thus aligned with the goals of the global action plan. The global launch took place on 25 November 2020.4 18. To support preparation and accelerate country adoption of the new global guidelines, virtual workshops were held in each of WHO’s six regions (June–July 2020), bringing together more than 67 Member States responsible for national guideline development across multiple ministries. The workshops and piloting of the adoption framework will support Member States to develop or update their national physical activity guidelines. Developing a global monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress on implementation of a global action plan 19. In developing a monitoring and evaluation framework the Secretariat has included identification, where possible, of existing indicators and data sources suitable for tracking progress on implementation of the 20 policy recommendations (see paragraph 9 of this annex). Consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders began with an expert meeting in November 2018 and continues, for instance with organizations in the United Nations development system, particularly United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), to ensure alignment with other relevant monitoring frameworks and Sustainable Development Goals. 20. The framework, comprising a set of process, outcome and impact indicators, is scheduled for publication as a technical report on the WHO website by the end of 2020. Global status report on physical activity 21. Preparation of the requested first global status report on physical activity began in parallel with work on the monitoring and evaluation framework. During 2019–2020 relevant data, including those from WHO’s global survey in 2019 of national capacity for NCD prevention and control1 and WHO’s road safety survey 2018,2 were analysed. 22. Workplans for 2020, including proposed global and regional consultations, collection and launch (scheduled for December 2020) of country best practice case studies, have been heavily disrupted by COVID-19. Consequently, the publication of this report has been postponed to 2021 to allow for full engagement of all relevant stakeholders. 23. The emerging findings reaffirm that progress on physical activity remains modest and uneven in reach and scale between and within regions. Further, the rate of country implementation suggests that continuing a “business as usual” approach is unlikely to achieve the global target of a 15% reduction in the global prevalence of physical inactivity by 2030. Impediments to implementing recommended, cost-effective actions at national and subnational levels must be identified and mitigated in order to accelerate global progress and impact. 1 WHO.

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018 (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/276462).  Major obstacles to increasing physical activity 24. Impediments identified across all regions include: (1) a lack of prioritization of policy on physical activity within and beyond the health sector; (2) lack of human and financial resources within the Secretariat and countries to develop, disseminate and implement policy actions on physical activity; (3) weak capacity to integrate approaches across multiple sectors and implement whole-of-system approaches; and (4) insufficient capacity to engage and sustain civil society, research communities and other key partners at national and subnational levels, particularly between health and relevant authorities for sport, transport, urban planning, design and environment. Accelerating increases in physical activity 25. In most Member States multiple opportunities exist to strengthen and accelerate actions aimed at retaining or increasing physical activity, particularly through walking and cycling, with the achievement of multiple other policy priorities. Areas of strong policy alignment include: healthy ageing; road safety; climate change mitigation; air quality; environmental sustainability; liveable cities and communities; and reduction of inequalities. 26. To support the scaling up of country efforts, WHO has strengthened partnership with stakeholders, including the sport and technology sectors, and established dialogues with the relevant private sector operators1 to engage and align their efforts towards achieving common goals of the global action plan. 27. Progress in implementation of the global action plan can also be accelerated by increased investment in the promotion of physical activity to youth and adolescents; expansion of workforce capacity and skills in the promotion of physical activity; strengthening national multisectoral coordination; investment in research and knowledge transfer, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and removing social, environmental and economic barriers to participation. 1 WHO. Engagement with the private sector for SDG target 3.4 on NCDs and mental health (https://www.who.int/ncds/governance/private-sector/en/, accessed 9 November 2020). Impact of COVID-19 on physical activity and responses 28. COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on how, where and for how long people can be physically active. Ensuring that the importance and protective benefits of physical activity on mental and physical health are recognized in countries’ responses to COVID-19 is vital, as is securing the inclusion of policies that embed equitable opportunities for physical activity in strategies to “build back better”. ANNEX 3 ENDING ALL FORMS OF MALNUTRITION 1. Sustainable Development Goal 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) has set the ambitious targets to eliminate all forms of malnutrition by the year 2030. The Health Assembly has been concerned about nutrition since its early years. In the past two decades it has dealt with unhealthy diets through the global strategy on diet, physical activity and health, endorsed in 2004 (resolution WHA57.17); all forms of malnutrition through the comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition, endorsed in 2012 (resolution WHA65.6 and later resolution WHA71.9 (2018) on infant and young child feeding); and the implementation plan of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity, welcomed in 2017 (decision WHA70(19)). The Health Assembly also endorsed the Rome Declaration, the outcome of the Second International Conference on Nutrition in 2014 (resolution WHA68.19 (2015)), and progress on its implementation has subsequently been reported biennially, together with the progress on the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, 2016–2025. 2. This annex provides an overview of the progress in the global nutrition situation and the policy response and reports more specifically on the outcomes of the Second International Conference on Nutrition. Progress in implementing resolutions WHA65.6 (2012) and WHA71.9 (2018) and decision WHA70.19 (2017) are reported in greater detail in the biennial reports delivered in even years. PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING GLOBAL TARGETS ON DIET AND NUTRITION 3. The concept of “all forms of malnutrition” is reflected in the global nutrition targets established by the Health Assembly in 2012 (resolution WHA65.6),1 which cover child wasting, stunting and overweight; anaemia in women of reproductive age; low birth weight; and exclusive breastfeeding. The first four targets are included in the formal monitoring system for the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, in 2013 the Health Assembly endorsed the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020 and adopted its nine voluntary global targets for 2025 in resolution WHA66.10 (2013), including the targets of halting the rise in diabetes and obesity and reducing the intake of salt/sodium. 4. The prevalence of adult obesity continues to rise in all WHO regions, from 11.8% in 2012 to 13.1% in 2016, so that the global target to halt the rise in obesity by 2025 is unlikely to be achieved. Excessive salt consumption is still responsible for an estimated three million deaths from heart disease, stroke and related causes. 5. In addition, in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, almost 690 million people (8.9% of the global population) were undernourished and two billion people (25.9% of the global population) experienced hunger or did not have regular access to nutritious and sufficient food. 1 Document WHA65/2012/REC/1, Annex 2 (Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition) (https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA65-REC1/A65_REC1-en.pdf). 6. Unhealthy diets account for an additional 11 million deaths. Sub-optimal diets are now responsible for 20% of premature (disease-mediated) mortality worldwide, as well as for 20% of all disability-adjusted life years lost to ill-health. PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FOOD AND NUTRITION POLICIES 7. WHO’s Global database on the Implementation of Nutrition Action1 contains information on national policies and strategies with nutrition goals, strategies or indicators in 194 Member States, of which 180 have comprehensive or topic-specific nutrition policies (on, for example, healthy diet, anaemia and breastfeeding). A third Global Nutrition Policy Review is in process. 8. National strategies that include specific goals, objectives, and actions to promote healthy diets. Most countries have adopted the global nutrition targets for 2025, covering for example stunting (117 Member States), anaemia in women (104), low birth weight (119), child overweight (137), exclusive breastfeeding (130) and wasting (111). The vast majority (186 Member States) include actions to promote healthy diets in their national policies and strategies, aiming to reduce consumption of fats (100 Member States), salt/sodium (142) or sugars (86). Population information policies through counselling or media campaigns are more common (181 Member States) than those that seek to change the food environment through nutrition labelling, marketing restrictions, fiscal policies or reformulation (156). 9. Labelling and health claim. Nutrition labelling was the intervention that saw the largest increase between WHO’s first and second global nutrition policy reviews in 2009–2010 and 2016–2017, respectively. National nutrition-labelling legislation defines the details on the information that should be available to consumers on pre-packaged food, including list of ingredients, nutrient declaration and the health or nutrient claims producers make on labels. As reported to the second review, 73 countries provided detailed information on their implementation of nutrient declaration and 69 countries on their regulation of nutrition and health claims. 10. Promotion of food products consistent with a healthy diet. Reformulation of food and beverage products is being implemented to reduce the content of saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sugars and salt/sodium. The recent WHO report on global trans-fatty acid elimination 20202 found that 58 countries so far have introduced laws to eliminate trans-fatty acids from the food supply; if successful, elimination will protect 3.2 billion people from those harmful substances by the end of 2021. 11. Fiscal policies. Currently 73 Member States impose taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, although the definitions, type and level of tax and range of products covered vary greatly. Twenty-nine Member States identify subsidies on healthy foods and beverages (for instance, fruits and vegetables) as suitable approaches to support healthy diets in their national strategies. 1 WHO.

Food programmes. Among the respondents to the Global Nutrition Policy Review 2016–2017,1 85 countries reported food distribution programmes as part of their social safety nets employed to address underlying causes of malnutrition, typically either emergency food aid programmes or special foods for infants and young children (or both). 13. School policies and programmes. The Global Nutrition Policy Review 2016–2017 recommended the strengthening of school health and nutrition programmes to ensure nutrition-friendly schools where policies, curriculum, environments and services are designed to promote healthy diets and support good nutrition. Most countries (89% of 160) reported having school health and nutrition programmes, but individual components of school programmes had largely deteriorated since the first Global Nutrition Policy Review in 2009–2010. 14. Health and other services. Among respondents to the Global Nutrition Policy Review 2016–2017, 153 countries reported employing nutrition professionals (that is, trained nutritionists or dieticians). However, the density was low (particularly in the African Region) – six countries had no nutrition professionals, and the global median among 126 countries providing details was only 2.3 trained nutrition professionals per 100 000 population. Pre-service and in-service training of health professionals in maternal, infant and young child nutrition was reported to be offered in 140 countries, although the number of hours in the pre-service curriculum dedicated to this topic was generally less than the number of hours dedicated to this subject area in WHO’s breastfeeding training course curricula. 1 WHO.

Following up on the outcomes of the Second International Conference on Nutrition, governments, organizations in the United Nations system, civil society and the private sector have been active in improving awareness and stimulating action to respond to a new nutritional reality characterized by all forms of malnutrition. A second report of the United Nations Secretary-General on the implementation of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition was published on 13 April 2020.2 Mid-term review 16. In keeping with the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s resolution E/RES/1989/84 on international decades, commitments made in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition should be reviewed at mid-term and at the end of the Decade of Action on Nutrition, in an open and participatory process. 17. The mid-term review foresight paper3 summarizes the progress in the six action areas of the Decade: (a) Sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy diets. In growing numbers, high-level reports and resolutions have underlined the crucial role of sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy diets and improved nutrition. Numerous alliances have been established to bring together different actors, beyond the traditional nutrition actors, for sustainable food systems. Recognition of agroecology and biodiversity, increased consideration of sustainability issues in national food-based dietary guidelines, growing implementation of measures to reduce food loss and waste, and action to enhance resilience of the food supply in crisis-prone areas have been noticed. Measures to reduce or eliminate industrially-produced trans-fatty acids have been accelerated, and voluntary or mandatory reformulation of processed food products has been carried out to reduce their salt/sodium content. (b) Aligned health systems providing universal coverage of essential nutrition actions. A clear understanding of the effective interventions to be delivered by health systems has emerged during the first half of the Decade, but there has been significant under-investment in both ensuring adequate coverage of high-impact nutrition interventions and improving their quality. To accelerate progress on wasting in children under five years of age, a United Nations global action plan on child wasting: a framework for action to accelerate progress in preventing and managing child wasting and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals1 was published on 9 March 2020. This plan will enable organizations of the United Nations development system to develop a more targeted road map for action in 2021. Strong health systems are needed to deliver nutrition actions, and the increasing political momentum for achieving universal health coverage presents new opportunities for expanding coverage and for mainstreaming WHO’s essential nutrition actions 2 through the life-course. (c) Social protection and nutrition education. The contributions of social protection to food security and nutrition will depend on its integration at policy level. To ensure that social protection policies holistically combat all forms of malnutrition, a nutrition-sensitive approach needs to be applied in their design and implementation. Policy measures for improving food access, social protection and food assistance are prevalent in some WHO regions, while in other WHO regions this continues to be an area of under-investment. Nutrition education is widely implemented in schools, but policies to ensure that education is supported by healthy school environments are lacking and implementation of school health and nutrition programmes has deteriorated in recent years. Although most countries train health workers on nutrition, the level of training is often inadequate and, more generally, nutrition action continues to be hampered by a lack of trained nutrition professionals. The potential of multi-component school-based programmes to educate about food and nutrition has been increasingly recognized as an important programmatic area for sustainable development. (d) Trade and investment for improved nutrition. Trade can be a key element in enhancing food security and nutrition, but there has been increasing recognition of the need for coherence between trade policy and nutrition action and the importance of governance and cross-sectoral cooperation. A finance gap persists, despite the need for responsible and sustainable investments in agriculture and food systems. Certain global value chains and agri-food industries currently produce environmentally unsustainable food products which commonly are rich in unhealthy fats, sugars and/or salt/sodium. Increased globalization of the food supply means populations are more 1 WHO.

Rather than driving healthy diets, trade and investment policies are exacerbating malnutrition in all its forms. Increased foreign direct investment, for example, has been linked to higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Prioritizing health over short-term economic gain has been shown to lead to greater economic gains in the long term. (e) Safe and supportive environments for nutrition at all ages. Creation of healthy food environments – encompassing availability, affordability, promotion and quality of food supporting healthy diets – has become a central consideration in nutrition policy-making. There is increasing momentum for the creation of healthy urban environments, with food environments an important element. Policies to create healthy food environments in schools, to protect and support breastfeeding or to fortify staple foods with micronutrients are widespread, although their implementation is often inadequate. Implementation of fiscal policies to promote healthy diets (particularly taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages) has accelerated over the first half of the Decade. There remains much scope to scale up and improve regulation of the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, strengthen the focus on adolescent nutrition and effectively integrate nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene programmes. (f) Strengthened governance and accountability for nutrition. Generating commitments and new financing for nutrition has progressed significantly. Despite considerable advances, however, the inadequate and highly variable progress towards the global nutrition and diet-related NCD targets reflects insufficient action to strengthen nutrition governance, policy and accountability systems. It also points to a persistent gap in global nutrition financing and the implementation of policy, legislative and regulatory measures, including fiscal measures as appropriate, aimed at ending all forms of malnutrition. Donor funding for nutrition increased during the first half of the Decade, but it is estimated that an additional US$ 7 billion is needed to achieve the global nutrition targets. Improved global data now identify those regions and countries that are progressing or falling behind, but weak or non-existent nutrition information systems and insufficient data – particularly on nutritional status in specific groups and over a long enough period to track trends – remain a substantial challenge. Contributions by different actors 18. Member States. Action by Member States is described above (paragraphs 7–17). No additional formal commitments have been made to the Decade besides those already published. 19. The Decade encourages United Nations Member States to strengthen collaboration on nutrition action by establishing action networks, which are informal coalitions of countries, with global or regional scope, aimed at accelerating and aligning efforts around specific topics linked to the Decade’s Work Programme. Led and coordinated by one or more countries, the action networks allow countries to exchange knowledge and good practices, successes and challenges, and provide mutual support to accelerate progress with the objective of improving food systems, diets and nutrition for all through policies and legislation.1 To date, the following global action networks have been convened under the Decade: (a) Global Action Network on Sustainable Food from the Oceans and Inland Waters for Food Security and Nutrition – lead country: Norway. 1 United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025.

In October 2019, Germany announced plans to form a world coalition on healthy school meals. Brazil and Sri Lanka are jointly developing a work programme. 21. Additionally, several regional networks have been convened for the Americas and the Pacific, namely: (a) Regional Action Network on Strategies for Reducing Salt Consumption for the Prevention and Control of Cardiovascular Disease in the Americas – lead countries: Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica. (b) Regional Action Network on Food Guidelines for the Region of the Americas – lead countries: Brazil and Uruguay. (c) Regional Action Network for the Americas on Food and Nutrition Security Governance – lead country: Brazil. (d) Regional Action Network for the Americas on Public Purchasing of Family-produced Food – lead country: Brazil. (e) Regional Action Network for the Americas on Sustainable School Feeding – lead country: Brazil. (f) Regional Action Network for the Americas on Healthy Food Environments – lead country: Chile. (g) Regional Action Network for Ending Childhood Obesity in the Pacific – lead country: Fiji 22. In order to support the implementation of the Decade, the Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO published in 2018 a guide1 for countries to translate the policies and actions recommended in the Framework for Action of the Second International Conference on Nutrition into country-specific commitments and a policy brief2 on driving commitment for nutrition within the Decade. 23. Organizations in the United Nations system have contributed to the Decade in accordance with their respective mandates.

Its strategy and vision for its work in nutrition1 were informed by the main challenges in nutrition and the Organization’s comparative strengths. 24. WHO published various normative products to support countries in the implementation of the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Nutrition, including essential nutrition actions, assessing and managing children at primary health care facilities to prevent overweight and obesity, fortification of rice with vitamins and minerals,2 effective actions for improving adolescent nutrition,3 and implementation guidance for the revised baby-friendly hospital initiative.4 25. The International Atomic Energy Agency has focused on strengthening collective actions across organizations, countries and communities to accelerate work on tackling the double burden of malnutrition, in particular in assessing the impact of programmes and initiatives targeting that double burden. Furthermore, attention needs to be paid to the role of stable isotope techniques in understanding biological pathways. 26. The International Fund for Agricultural Development issued in 2019 its nutrition action plan 2019–2025,5 with the overall objective to accelerate mainstreaming of nutrition in its investments and to realize its commitment to increasing the target of mainstreaming nutrition into 50% of projects in their design stage and improve the nutrition of 12 million people by 2021. 27. The vision of UNICEF’s strategic plan for 2018–20216 is to consolidate and expand the programmatic gains of addressing child malnutrition in all its forms around the world, in order to meet by 2021 three annual targets of reaching at least: (i) 250 million children under five years of age with services to prevent stunting and other forms of malnutrition; (ii) 100 million adolescents with services to prevent anaemia and other forms of malnutrition; and (iii) 6 million children with services to treat severe wasting and other forms of acute malnutrition in development and humanitarian contexts. 28. The World Food Programme continued delivering optimal nutrition programming on treatment and prevention as an emergency response, while integrating nutrition-sensitive approaches across the humanitarian-development nexus. 29. The United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition continued working towards maximizing coherence of United Nations policies and accountability, with advocacy for nutrition, building bridges, 1 FAO.

The United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on Non-communicable Diseases, through its thematic working group on nutrition convened by the Standing Committee on Nutrition, continued to work on all forms of malnutrition. 31. The 2019 report of the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food to the General Assembly focused on the Sustainable Development Goals1 through a human rights-based approach to nutrition policies, emphasizing in particular the inequitable distribution of food and productive resources as a significant barrier to the realization of the right to food and nutrition. 1 UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food.

The Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit, postponed to December 2021,2 will provide an opportunity for taking stock and making new financial and policy commitments at the mid-term of the Decade. It will bring together countries, donors and partners to present clear commitments and demonstrate progress towards the targets endorsed by the Health Assembly and those of the Sustainable Development Goals. It aims to obtain commitments in five priority areas: (1) health: making nutrition integral to universal health coverage for sustainable development; (2) food: building food systems that promote healthy diets and nutrition, ensure livelihoods of producers and are climate-smart; (3) resilience: tackling malnutrition effectively in fragile and conflict-affected contexts; (4) promoting data-driven accountability; and (5) securing new investment and driving innovation in nutrition financing. In 2019, WHO led the development of the universal health coverage component of the Nutrition for Growth’s commitment framework and published the Nutrition in UHC policy brief.3 33. In 2021, United Nations will convene a Food Systems Summit as part of the Decade of Action. The Summit will cover five action tracks: (1) ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all (enabling all people to be nourished and healthy, progressive realization of the right to food); (2) shifting to sustainable consumption patterns (promoting and creating demand for healthy and sustainable diets, reducing waste); (3) boosting nature-positive production at sufficient scale (acting on climate change, reducing emissions and increasing carbon capture, regenerating and protecting critical ecosystems and reducing food loss and energy usage, without undermining health or nutritious diets); (4) advancing equitable livelihoods and value distribution (raising incomes, distributing risk, expanding inclusion, promote full and productive employment and decent work for all); and (5) building resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stress (ensuring the continued functionality of healthy and sustainable food systems). WHO has been asked to be the anchor United Nations body for track (2). ANNEX 4 HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ADDRESSING THE HEALTH IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION 1. This annex summarizes progress in the implementation of resolution WHA68.8 (2015) on addressing the health impact of air pollution and the related road map for an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects.1 (For further information see the progress report submitted to the Seventy-third World Health Assembly.)2 2. Work has substantially advanced the development of knowledge products and tools to measure the health effects and health-care cost of air pollution. These include the means to assess health impact and health economic and sector-specific tools, at both national and subnational levels. The update of the WHO air quality guidelines is at an advanced stage. 3. WHO has reported and will continue to report regularly on three air pollution-related Sustainable Development Goal indicators: 3.9.1 (mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution), 7.1.2 (proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology) and 11.6.2 (annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (for example, PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)). To further support countries in monitoring these indicators, the Secretariat has developed more robust statistical methods and enhanced survey tools to better assess the health impacts of ambient air pollution and household energy use. 4. WHO’s databases on ambient air pollution and household energy have been updated regularly and expanded to include more locations, pollutants and sources of exposure. 5. Advances have been made to raise the priority accorded to air pollution on regional agendas through the development of regional plans of action and the creation of country air pollution and health profiles in selected Member States at their request. 6. WHO, in collaboration with other organizations in the United Nations development system, has developed the global BreatheLife Network to raise awareness about the scale and importance of air pollution as a health risk and to share solutions and mobilize action. Since its launch in October 2016, 76 city, regional or country governments level have officially joined the BreatheLife Network; global awareness was raised in 2018 through WHO’s First Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health. With growing recognition of air pollution as a public health threat, countries are scaling up commitments to implement air quality policies and to align climate and air quality. In 2018, at the first WHO international conference on air pollution and health, 26 countries, 12 cities, 11 organizations of the United Nations development system, 39 nongovernmental organizations and the European Union committed themselves to a range of interventions to address air pollution.

WHO, with other organizations of the United Nations development system, launched the Health and Energy Platform for Action1 at a side-event at the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in 2019. The Platform aims to strengthen the political and technical cooperation between the health and energy sectors at global, regional and country levels to accelerate the transition to clean energy, with an initial focus on clean cooking and electrification of health care facilities. 8. One highly significant achievement is the recognition of air pollution as a fifth major risk factor for NCDs at the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in 2018 and the inclusion of air pollution into multisectoral regional and national NCD action plans. In this context the Secretariat has advanced its work on developing policy options on ambient and household air pollution that will contribute to the achievement of the objectives and voluntary global targets of the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020. The first phase of this work consists in compiling a compendium of WHO’s and other United Nations’ guidance on health and environment, including air pollution. Subsequent in-depth analyses of the effectiveness of existing interventions will draw on the compendium and other existing WHO guidelines and recommendations. 9. Over the past years, WHO has been developing and enhancing a set of analytical tools to build the evidence of the health and economic effects of air pollution, for instance the AirQ+ software tool and sector-specific tools such as the health and economic assessment tool for walking and cycling. The Secretariat has undertaken rapid situational assessments and stakeholder mappings for the Clean Household Energy Solutions Toolkit in countries where reliance on the use of biomass for cooking purposes is heavy. It is currently developing training materials for health-care professionals, aimed at strengthening capacity to understand the risks of air pollution to health and to communicate them to patients and communities. 10. The Secretariat has been working continuously to provide direct country support, with targeted technical training workshops intended to enhance institutional capacities to address air pollution and health. In addition, WHO has undertaken several joint missions with other United Nations bodies in order to plan and enhance country support. 1 WHO, UNDP.

In response to paragraph 3(a) of decision WHA72(11) (2019), in which the Health Assembly requests the Director-General, inter alia, to propose updates to the appendices of WHO’s comprehensive mental health action plan, in consultation with Member States and taking into account the view of other stakeholders, the Secretariat has taken the following steps to update Appendix 1 (Indicators for measuring progress towards defined targets) and Appendix 2 (Options for the implementation of the comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2020) of that action plan: • March 2020. A virtual consultation with Member States was organized by the regional offices for Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean in order to seek views on the “zero draft” of updated Appendix 1 and the pre-existing (2013) version of Appendix 2. Additionally, Member States of the Western Pacific Region were consulted by email to seek views on the “zero draft” of updated Appendix 1. A web-based consultation for Member States, organizations in the United Nations system and non-State actors on the “zero draft” of updated Appendix 1 and the pre-existing (2013) version of Appendix 2 was conducted • July 2020. Virtual consultations were organized by the Regional Office for the Western Pacific to seek the views of the Region’s Member States on the pre-existing (2013) version of Appendix 2. • August–September 2020. A virtual consultation with Member States was organized by the regional offices for Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean to seek views on the “zero draft” of updated Appendix 2. That text was also the subject of a web-based consultation for Member States, organizations in the United Nations system and non-State actors. 2. The resulting updated Appendix 1 (see below) includes the updated indicators and targets to monitor the comprehensive mental health action plan up to 2030. 3. The resulting updated Appendix 2 (see below) has been modified through strengthened text on suicide prevention, workplace mental health, universal health coverage, mental health of children, mental health across the life course, multisectoral work, human rights, and involvement of people with lived experience of mental health conditions.    Appendix 1 PROPOSED UPDATED APPENDIX 1 OF THE COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH ACTION PLAN 2013–2030: INDICATORS FOR MEASURING PROGRESS TOWARDS DEFINED TARGETS 1. The updated indicators for assessing progress towards meeting the global targets of Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 represent a subset of the information and the reporting needs that Member States require to be able to monitor adequately their mental health policies and programmes. Given that targets are voluntary and global, each Member State is not necessarily expected to achieve all the specific targets but can contribute to a varying extent towards reaching them jointly. 2. The global targets established for each objective provide the basis for measurable collective action and progress by Member States towards global goals and should not negate the setting of more ambitious national targets, particularly for those countries that have already reached global ones. 3. As indicated under Objective 4 of the plan, the Secretariat will continue providing guidance, training and technical assistance to Member States, upon request, on the development of national information systems for capturing data on indicators of mental health system inputs, activities and outcomes. The aim is to keep building on existing information systems rather than creating new or parallel systems. Objective 1: To strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health Global target 1.1: 80% of countries will have developed or updated their policy or plan for mental health in line with international and regional human rights instruments, by 2030.  Indicator 1.1: Existence of a national policy or plan for mental health that is being implemented and in line with international human rights instruments.  Means of verification:  Physically available policy or plan; confirmation that it accords with international and regional human rights standards; and assessment of implementation status.  Comments, assumptions and/or rationale:  For countries with a federated system, the indicator will refer to policies or plans of most states or provinces within the country.

relevant subnational levels (for example, district, municipality and community levels). • Sensitize policy-makers to mental health and human rights issues through the preparation of policy briefs and scientific publications and the provision of leadership courses and other learning and knowledge exchange opportunities in mental health. • Undertake capacity-building among stakeholders including policy-makers regarding strategies to promote respect for people’s will and preference in mental health and related services. • Mainstream mental health and the rights of persons with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities into all sectoral policies, laws and strategies (for example, health, social affairs, education, justice and labour/employment) including emergency preparedness and response, poverty reduction and development. • Improve accountability by setting up mechanisms, using independent bodies, to monitor, prevent and respond to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and other forms of ill-treatment and abuse; collect data on restrain and seclusion and involuntary treatments; and involve appropriate stakeholder groups in these mechanisms, for example, lawyers and people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities, in a manner consistent with international human rights instruments. • Amend or repeal legislation that perpetuates stigmatization, discrimination and human rights violations against people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities.    • Monitor and evaluate the implementation of policies and legislation to ensure compliance with international human rights conventions including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on the Right of the Child, as appropriate, and feed this information into the reporting mechanism of these conventions. • Establish supported decision-making mechanisms; help people to develop advance plans that state their will and preference should they experience a crisis in the future; and ensure that people have all the supports they require in order to make a decision, including access to trusted persons and advocates and provision of valid information about all matters relevant to their decision.  Resource planning: Plan according to measured or systematically estimated need and allocate a budget, across all relevant sectors, that is commensurate with identified human and other resources required to implement agreed-upon, evidence-based mental health plans and actions.  • Include mental health

This annex describes progress in providing Member States with concrete guidance to strengthen health literacy through education programmes and population-wide targeted and mass- and social-media campaigns to reduce the impact of all risk factors and determinants of noncommunicable diseases. Context 2. In 2014, at the second High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on Non-communicable Diseases, ministers and representatives of States and Governments committed themselves to “continue to develop, strengthen and implement appropriate multisectoral public policies and action plans to promote health education and health literacy, with a particular focus on populations with low health awareness and/or literacy.”1 3. The Shanghai Declaration on promoting health in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted at the 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion, held in China from 21 to 24 November 2016,2 highlighted health literacy as one of the main pillars of health promotion for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 4. At the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on Non-communicable Diseases in 2018, Heads of State and Government committed themselves to “empower the individual to make informed choices by providing an enabling environment, strengthening health literacy through education, and implementing population-wide and targeted mass and social media campaigns that educate the public about NCD risk factors.”3 5. These commitments remain largely unmet. 6. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, health literacy has been shown to be one of the key drivers of a successful response, as people’s knowledge and abilities to obtain, understand, judge and take decisions based on evidenced-based information are essential. 1 In accordance with paragraph 30(a)(iii) of United Nations General Assembly resolution 68/300. 2 In accordance with preambular paragraph 6 of resolution WHA71.2. 3 In accordance with paragraph 334 of United Nations General Assembly resolution 73/2. 4 WHO. The WHO GCM/NCD Working Group on health education and health literacy for NCDs (Working Group 3.3, 2016–2017) (https://www.who.int/global-coordination-mechanism/working-groups/working-group-3-3/en/, accessed 7 December 2020). Providing Member States with concrete guidance to strengthen health literacy approaches for the prevention and control of NCDs and mental health conditions 7. The Director-General convened a working group on health education and health literacy for NCDs4 of global experts nominated by Member States from 2017 to 2019 and supported by WHO’s Global coordination mechanism for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases to recommend ways and means of encouraging Member States and non-State actors to promote health education and health literacy for the prevention and control of NCDs. The group focused in particular on populations with low health awareness and/or literacy and took into account WHO’s best buys and other recommended interventions for the prevention and control of NCDs. 8. The final report from the working group has been designated a WHO Global Public Health Good for the period 2020–2021 and is being finalized. Its guidance will support the implementation of practical health literacy approaches to accelerate the prevention and control of NCDs at national level, including use of an implementation toolkit. The draft final report will be presented for broad consultation, including Member States, all three levels of WHO, and selected and relevant external stakeholders, during the first quarter of 2021, before its recommendations are piloted across WHO regions. 9. Under the auspices of the WHO Working Group on health education and health literacy, the Secretariat, developed ways to support the implementation of national health literacy demonstration projects across WHO’s regions. 10. The Secretariat created a community of practice whose members met to build expertise and resources to improve health literacy approaches for the prevention and control of NCDs and mental health conditions. 11. The WHO European Action Network on Health Literacy for Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases1 was launched in 2019 to support Member States in the European Region to attain target 3.4 of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (by 2030 reduce by one third pre-mature mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) through prevention and treatment, and promote mental health and well-being) through interventions based on health literacy. 12. In 2019 the Regional Committee of Europe at its sixty-ninth session, in resolution EUR/RC69/R9 “Towards the implementation of health literacy initiatives through the life course”, took note of the WHO European road map for implementation of health literacy initiatives through the life course and urged Member States to strengthen implementation of health literacy initiatives in various areas of action, environments and settings, including by using innovations. 1 Drapkina O, de Graca Freitas M, Mikkelsen B, Breda J, Salakhov E, Lopatina M, Silva da Costa A, Koylyu A, Williams J, Wickramasinghe K, Telo de Arriaga M.

Recommendation 2 of the final report of the WHO Independent High-level Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases2 requests the Secretariat to “support countries in their national efforts to empower individuals to make healthy choices and make the healthiest choice the easiest choice, including through the creation of enabling environments and the promotion of health literacy”. 14. The Secretariat is developing a toolkit for behavioural change communication campaigns on NCD risk factors and mental health conditions, targeted at children and adolescents. This toolkit will build on the WHO Strategic Communications Framework1 and will prioritize a catalogue of communications knowledge, skills, contextual best practices, innovative approaches and resources for effective communication to particular target audiences and the use of emerging technologies in communicating messages about NCD risk factors and the promotion of healthy behaviours. 15. In 2020, WHO published a handbook on life skills education about prevention of noncommunicable diseases.2 Its purpose is to support schools in implementing interventions aimed at reducing the main modifiable risk behaviours for noncommunicable diseases. 16. The Secretariat will update this annex in its report to the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly in May 2021. 1 WHO. WHO Strategic Communications Framework.

This annex describes the process that the Secretariat will follow to analyse, on the basis of a review of international experiences, successful approaches to multisectoral action for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including those that address their social, economic and environmental determinants. 2. WHO’s 2008–2013 action plan for the global strategy for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases included an action for the Secretariat to “conduct a review of international experience in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including community-based programmes, and identify and disseminate lessons learned”. Owing to lack of resources, this first global stocktaking report on multisectoral action for NCDs was not prepared at the time. Taking into account this gap, decision WHA72(11) (2019) reiterated this request to the Director-General: to submit “in the consolidated report to the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly in 2021, based on a review of international experiences, an analysis of successful approaches to multisectoral action for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including those that address the social, economic and environmental determinants of such diseases”. 3. The Secretariat will take the following actions: • In 2022, it will launch a publicly-accessible NCD multisectoral action repository to serve as a tool for governments to: • draw attention to national or local multisectoral projects in support of target 3.4 of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (by 2030 reduce by one third pre-mature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment, and promote mental health and well-being) at the global level; • submit descriptions of national projects serving as best practices for others, and update on a continuous basis; • extend networks by contacting directly project owners in other countries. • In 2022, it plans to launch the first stocktaking report on multisectoral action for NCDs with the aim of updating governments and partners on multisectoral activities undertaken to accelerate progress towards target 3.4. The report will be updated annually, building on calls for new entries into the database. • In 2023, the Secretariat will submit an analysis of successful approaches to the Executive Board at its 150th session. ANNEX 8 ANALYSIS OF HOW FOOD PROCUREMENT IN SCHOOLS AND OTHER RELEVANT INSTITUTIONS CAN BE MADE SUPPORTIVE OF HEALTHY DIETS 1. This annex reports the progress on the implementation of decision WHA72(11) (2019) that requested the Director-General “to collect and share best practices for the prevention of overweight and obesity, and in particular to analyse how food procurement in schools and other relevant institutions can be made supportive of healthy diets and lifestyles in order to address the epidemic of childhood overweight and obesity and reduce malnutrition in all its forms”. Context 2. Every day, foods, beverages, meals and snacks are served and sold in public institutions. In addition, many governments also purchase foods for government-funded programmes, such as school meal programmes and social protection programmes. Collectively, these public settings and programmes have a large population reach, including vulnerable groups such as children and older people. 3. Governments worldwide therefore have a unique opportunity – as well as responsibility – to lead by example through the implementation of healthy public food procurement policies that ensure that the food served or sold in public settings or purchased (or subsidized) by government contributes to promoting healthy diets and preventing all forms of malnutrition, including obesity and diet-related NCDs. In addition to these public health benefits, healthy public food-procurement policies can have economic benefits, improve productivity and educational attainment, help to increase the availability of healthy, affordable foods and may also contribute to boosting local agriculture. School food policies 4. In the Global Nutrition Policy Review 2016–2017, most countries (89% of 160) reported having school health and nutrition programmes, but schools remain an underused delivery platform for promoting good nutrition and healthy diets, especially as they can address issues related to both undernutrition and overweight and obesity. 5. The Secretariat has analysed measures applied to foods and beverages served or sold in and around schools, drawing on 128 documents from 83 Member States included in WHO’s Global database on the implementation of nutrition action.1 About half (42 Member States) had legislative measures (such as laws, decrees and ordinances) published in official gazettes, often including an enforcement mechanism. These were issued as stand-alone school food and nutrition legislation or incorporated into broader school-related laws (on, for instance, feeding programmes, health or hygiene) or into other legislative measures (for example, marketing restrictions, public catering laws, public health codes, and child health and nutrition laws). Another 10 countries had compulsory standards for foods and beverages in schools, while 25 countries had government-issued guides for school foods and beverages that were typically promoted through ministry websites or reports. Nine countries had stated the requirements for school food and beverages in national school nutrition policies. Among the 77 countries with legislation, 1 This includes 8 countries in the African Region, 17 in the Region of the Americas, 4 in the South-East Asia Region, 37 in the European Region, 6 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 11 in the Western Pacific Region. standards or guides on school foods and beverages, 73 countries covered foods and beverages offered during school lunches and often also other meals or snacks provided. Furthermore, 52 countries had measures that covered foods and beverages sold at school, in cafeterias, food stores, snack bars or vending machines. Less frequently, measures covered foods and beverages available at school activities or events (10 countries) or extended to sales around schools (for example, in radius of 200 meters around the school premises – three countries). Several countries (22) extended the measures to foods and beverages marketed in schools, including sponsorships. Only three countries extended the measures to foods brought from home. 6. The measures typically involved food-based criteria that promoted healthier foods and beverages (74 countries) especially fruits and vegetables (69 countries), water for drinking (57 countries) and whole-grain varieties of cereals and cereal products (43 countries). For proteins, the measures recommended leaner cuts of meat, fish or eggs (38 countries) or the use of pulses and legumes (43 countries), often as replacement of animal-sourced products on a number of days of the week. The measures often recommended the use of unsaturated oils for cooking (26 countries). Fewer measures promoted fortified foods, including iodized salt (12 countries) or fortified staple foods (six countries). 7. Most countries also listed foods and beverages that were prohibited, to be avoided or to be limited in schools (67 countries). This most commonly applied to various kinds of confectionary, savoury snacks, cakes and pastries (49 countries), fried foods (36 countries) and salt and condiments with a high sodium content (35 countries). For beverages, 48 countries prohibited or limited carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks, and 26 countries prohibited energy and sport drinks. Specific prohibitions or limitations were less common for other sugar-sweetened beverages, such as juice drinks (22 countries), sweetened flavoured milks (19 countries), beverages prepared from liquid and powder concentrates (16 countries) or 100% fruit or vegetable juices (12 countries). In fact, many countries promoted juices (both diluted and 100%) to be served or sold in schools. 8. In 46 countries the measures included nutrient-based criteria for foods and beverages offered in schools, based on total fat (36 countries), sugars (34 countries), salt/sodium (33 countries), energy (28 countries), saturated fatty acids (23 countries) or trans-fatty acids (18 countries). Many countries provided indications on the portions to be served in school, and 28 countries used this policy measure as a way to limit items that do not form part of healthy diets. Action Framework for Developing and Implementing Public Food Procurement Policies for a Healthy Diet1 1 WHO. Action Framework for Developing and Implementing Public Food Procurement Policies for a Healthy Diet. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2020 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240018341, accessed 12 January 2021). 2 Settings and facilities considered are: day-care centres or child-care facilities, schools, after-school/summer programmes, post-secondary institutions, universities, hospitals, long-term and residential aged care facilities, government workplaces, farmers’ markets, public parks, community centres, sport and recreation facilities, railway stations, public bus stands, airports, military bases, prisons and juvenile detention facilities, cafeterias/cafes, canteens, restaurants, snack shops, food kiosks, tuck shops, and vending machines. The analysis also considered school meal programmes, social services, social support programmes, homeless shelters, food pantries, supplemental feeding programmes, sport events held in public settings, government-sponsored meetings and conferences. 9. To support Member States in implementing a healthy public food procurement policy, the Secretariat has collected several country examples and developed an action framework for developing and implementing public food procurement policies for a healthy diet. The action framework was peer-reviewed by experts, policy-makers and practitioners from Member States from all WHO regions and contains various country case studies and best practices.2 10. The framework illustrates key steps to take in developing or revising a healthy public food-procurement policy, and ways to prepare an implementation plan and to monitor and enforce the policy. It proposes how to conduct a landscape analysis and engage with a lead government authority to review existing policies in consultation with stakeholders. A step-wise approach is also suggested. Nutrient or food-based criteria, as well as other criteria such as portion size, will have to complement such policies, and food safety considerations will have to be included.

This annex describes the process that the Secretariat is following to draw up guidance to Member States, in response to paragraph 40 of the Political Declaration of the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases,1 on how to strengthen the design and implementation of policies, including those for resilient health systems and health services and infrastructure to treat people living with NCDs and to prevent and control their risk factors in humanitarian emergencies. 2. It also provides an update on the Secretariat’s work in response to paragraphs 31, 46 and 48 of WHO’s global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–20302 to ensure continuity of essential NCD services, including availability of life-saving technologies and essential medicines, in humanitarian emergencies. 1 United Nations General Assembly.

The number of people currently affected by humanitarian emergencies worldwide is unprecedented. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 168 million people would need humanitarian aid and protection in 2020.3 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is aggravating this situation, placing an additional burden on already fragile health systems and disrupting essential health services around the world. 4. NCDs such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries, which are especially vulnerable to the effects of conflict, epidemics, natural disasters, and forced displacement. In 2017, NCDs accounted for between 24% and 68% of mortality in the top five source countries for refugees. 5. Interruption of care, sudden shifts in priorities of the health care system, the inability of health facilities to function safely and provide quality care for all patients, changes in diet and physical activity habits, increase in stress levels, decrease in medication adherence and precipitation of an acute exacerbation in a chronic condition – all result in excess morbidity and mortality related to NCDs during emergencies and disasters.1 6. The health component of humanitarian responses to emergencies has traditionally focused on communicable diseases and injury management, with NCDs being poorly addressed. Capacity and resources for NCD service provision are often already inadequate in low- and lower middle-income settings. A humanitarian emergency makes this more evident, causing NCD-related premature mortality, morbidity and economic difficulty on top of the damage caused by other aspects of the emergency. 7. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new level of urgency to the need for improving NCD management as part of emergency preparedness and response. NCDs and their risk factors increase both susceptibility to infection and the likelihood of severe outcomes from COVID-19. At the same time, NCD services have been severely disrupted,2 leaving many people with NCDs without the health services and medicines they need. 1 WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia.

Some progress has been made in raising awareness and producing guidance to support Member States and humanitarian agencies in ensuring continuity of NCD care in emergencies: • NCDs in emergencies: a WHO/UNHCR policy brief3 describes global minimum standards and priority actions for NCD care in preparation for, response to and recovery from humanitarian emergencies. • Integration of NCD care in emergency response and preparedness: a technical guidance document from the Regional Office for South-East Asia4 outlines relevant priority actions to integrate NCD interventions into national health emergency preparedness and responses. • Prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases in refugees and migrants: technical guidance from the Regional Office for Europe5 outlines key priority areas for interventions within refugee and migrant groups. • In June 2015 an informal working group on NCDs in humanitarian settings was set up as an informal platform to share lessons learned and to harmonize and draft technical guidance for dealing with NCDs in humanitarian settings. It is chaired by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and WHO participates. • WHO’s operational guidance for maintaining essential health services in the COVID-19 context1 provides an entry point for prioritizing essential NCD services in emergencies. The Secretariat is adapting guidance for the humanitarian context the Global Health Cluster COVID-19 Task Team. 9. The Inter-Agency Emergency Health Kit2 has been revised to include essential NCD medicines. The Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean developed an additional NCD kit3 to provide essential medicines and medical devices for the management of most common NCDs encountered at primary health care level. Since 2017, the kit has been used in, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Libya, Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, and is pre-positioned in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem and the WHO Operations Supply and Logistics Hub in Dubai. 10. NCDs remain a neglected aspect of humanitarian responses, however, with significant gaps in technical and operational guidance, lack of capacity and resources in the Secretariat at headquarters and in regions and countries, and insufficient integration of NCDs into emergency preparedness and response plans, humanitarian data collection systems, and dashboards. 1 WHO.

In order to support Member States in their commitment to strengthen policies to treat people living with NCDs and prevent and control their risk factors in humanitarian emergencies, the Secretariat is undertaking work in the following areas: • governance: to establish an integrated approach to addressing NCDs in humanitarian emergencies across the Organization, including the Global Health Cluster. • normative work: to comprehensively map existing policies, guidelines and tools to address NCDs in humanitarian settings in order to fill gaps in guidance for governments and humanitarian agencies. • technical assistance: to propose ways to improve support to countries across preparedness, response and recovery, leveraging crises as an entry-point to build health systems back better through development of sustainable NCD services. • research: to continue existing work with academic partners to shape the research agenda so as to inform policies to strengthen emergency preparedness and responses. • financing: to advocate with donors the prioritization of building bridges with a view to prioritizing NCDs in humanitarian emergencies across the health, development and peace-building sectors. 12. The Secretariat will update this annex in its report to the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly in May 2021.  ANNEX 10 UPDATE ON THE WORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS INTER-AGENCY TASK FORCE ON THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES 1. This annex provides an update on the work of the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases in the implementation of WHO’s global action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases 2013–2020, the Political Declaration on the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases (General Assembly resolution 73/2 (2018)), Health Assembly decision WHA72(11) (2019) on follow up to that political declaration, and resolution E/RES/2019/9 of the United Nations Economic and Social Council on the Task Force.1 2. The Task Force ensures coordinated action across the United Nations system to support Member States achieve the Sustainable Development Goals related to NCDs. It delivers high-quality technical support to advance multisectoral action in countries. Over the past year, three members of the Task Force – the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, International Labour Organization and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - have published briefs on NCDs; altogether now 12 members have published briefs under the Task Force.2 3. The report of the Director-General on the Task Force, submitted to the Economic and Social Council in March 2020,3 described progress and achievements over the past year in line with the Task Force’s strategic priorities,4 including joint programming missions, joint programmes and initiatives, the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All5 and progress on establishing a United Nations NCD and mental health multi-partner trust fund to support countries in scaling up action on NCDs and mental health. The report also highlighted the linkages between NCDs and COVID-19. 4. The Economic and Social Council, in resolution 2020/22 on the work of the Task Force,6 called upon the members of the Task Force to continue to work together to identify additional technical 1 United Nations Economic and Social Council.

In September 2020, the publication of WHO, United Nations Development Programme and the Task Force on responding to NCDs during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, to which more than 30 Task Force members contributed, was launched.1 It builds on WHO’s operational guidance on how to maintain essential health services for NCDs and mental health during the pandemic. It is aimed at governments, policy-makers, organizations in the United Nations system and development partners and explains why strong action on NCDs must be an integral part of the COVID-19 response and recovery. 6. The Economic and Social Council’s resolution E/RES/2019/9 on the work of the Task Force in 2019 encouraged the mobilization of resources through innovative funding mechanisms, including a dedicated multi-partner trust fund. As a result, the Task Force Secretariat has drafted terms of reference with the United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office as the administrative agent. In the first instance, the trust fund will support low- and middle-income countries accessing catalytic resources to tackle NCDs, as part of their national COVID-19 response and recovery plans. 7. In February 2020, the Task Force and WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Programme undertook a joint mission to Nigeria with 15 agencies and bilateral development partners. 8. Members of the Task Force continue to deliver joint programmes to support countries in advancing action on NCDs. One example is the WHO/United Nations Development Programme joint project to catalyse multisectoral action on NCDs, which to date has worked with Member States to deliver 26 cases for investment in NCD prevention and control and mental health. The investment cases provide countries with evidence and arguments to strengthen legislative, fiscal and regulatory measures at the country level. 9. An example of a new programme established in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic is the Access Initiative for Quitting Tobacco2 which works with governments, the United Nations and the private sector to accelerate tobacco cessation in low- and middle-income countries. 10. Task Force members are committed to align their NCD and mental health activities with the United Nations’ comprehensive response to COVID-19, for example through: (i) raising national awareness on return on investment in NCD prevention and treatment to secure domestic budgetary allocations and financing for development discussions: (ii) by helping countries to include NCDs into their socioeconomic response plans; and (iii) participating in the WHO Working Group on COVID-19 and NCDs. WHO’s global action plan for healthy lives and well-being continues to provide an important platform for many members of the Task Force to work through. 1 WHO/UNDP.
