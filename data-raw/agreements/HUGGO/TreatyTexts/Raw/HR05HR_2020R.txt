Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, held in Geneva from 9 to 12 December 2019, of resolution 33IC/19/R2 on addressing mental health and psychosocial needs of people affected by armed conflicts, natural disasters and other emergencies, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing, Reaffirming also that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and recognizing that these rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person, Reaffirming further that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, the equal right to live independently and be included in the community and the right to equal recognition before the law, which includes the enjoyment of legal capacity on an equal basis with others, and that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,  Recalling the general principles reflected in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, namely respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy and independence, non-discrimination, and full and effective participation and inclusion in society, Reaffirming the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and emphasizing that mental health is an integral part of that right, Welcoming the work of the treaty bodies and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council relating to issues of mental health and human rights, and taking note of their respective general comments and reports, Reaffirming the right of everyone to be guaranteed the full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, without discrimination of any kind, Deeply concerned that persons with mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities, including persons using mental health services, continue to be subject to, inter alia, widespread, multiple, intersecting and aggravated discrimination, stigma, stereotypes, prejudice, violence, abuse, social exclusion and segregation, unlawful and arbitrary deprivation of liberty and institutionalization, overmedicalization and treatment practices that fail to respect their autonomy, will and preferences, Equally concerned that such practices may constitute or lead to violations and abuses of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, sometimes amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Equally concerned also that suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people aged from 15 to 29 years, and is among the top 20 leading causes of death worldwide, and acknowledging that suicide attempts and self-harm must be addressed through prevention strategies and support services that promote and respect human rights and fight stigma and discrimination, Recognizing the need to protect, promote and respect all human rights in the global response to mental health-related issues, and stressing that mental health and community services should integrate a human rights perspective so as to avoid any harm to persons using them and to respect their dignity, integrity, enjoyment of legal capacity on an equal basis with others, choices and inclusion in the community, Emphasizing that States should ensure that persons with mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities, in particular persons using mental health services, have access to a range of support services, including peer support, that are based on respect for human rights in order to live independently, be included in the community, exercise their autonomy and agency, participate meaningfully in and decide upon all matters affecting them and have their dignity respected, on an equal basis with others, Reiterating how important it is for States to adopt, implement, update, strengthen or monitor, as appropriate, laws, policies and practices to eradicate any form of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuse in the context of mental health, Recognizing the particularly important role that psychiatry and other mental health professions should have, alongside, inter alia, government institutions and services, actors within the justice system, including the penitentiary system, civil society organizations and national human rights institutions, in taking measures to ensure that practices in the field of mental health do not perpetuate stigma, discrimination and social exclusion, coercion, overmedicalization and institutionalization that lead to violations or abuses of human rights, Acknowledging that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities laid the foundation for a paradigm shift in mental health and created the momentum for deinstitutionalization and the identification of models of care and support based on respect for human rights that, inter alia, address the underlying determinants of mental health, provide effective mental health and community-based services and psychosocial support, reduce power asymmetries in mental health settings and respect the enjoyment of autonomy on an equal basis with others, Reaffirming that the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is an inclusive right that encompasses tackling the underlying determinants of health through interventions, policies and programmes that protect persons from key risk factors of poor health, Recalling that, according to the Constitution of the World Health Organization, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, Acknowledging that good mental health and well-being cannot be defined by the absence of a mental health condition or psychosocial disability but rather by an environment that enables individuals and populations to live a life of dignity, with full enjoyment of their rights, in the equitable pursuit of their potential, and that values both social connection and respect through non-violent and healthy relationships at the individual and societal levels, and recognizing that discriminatory laws, policies, practices and attitudes undermine the social structures required to support well-being and inclusion, Concerned that there is a continuing lack of parity between physical and mental health reflected in the marginalization of mental health within health policies and budgets or in medical education, research and practice, and stressing the importance of investing more on mental health promotion through a multisectoral approach that is based on respect for human rights and that also addresses the underlying social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health, Reaffirming the right of refugees and migrants to the enjoyment, without discrimination, of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and underscoring the vulnerable situations that can have a negative impact on the mental health of persons on the move, Recognizing that women and girls with mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities at all ages, in particular those using mental health services, face an increased vulnerability to violence, abuse, discrimination and negative stereotyping, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure access to mental health and community services that are gender-sensitive, Acknowledging the intersections between mental health and HIV and that the multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuse often faced by people living with, presumed to be living with or affected by HIV/AIDS and members of key populations have negative consequences on their enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental health, and underlining the importance of improving psychosocial well-being and the quality of life of people affected and living with HIV through the implementation of community-, evidence- and human rights-based and people-centred policies and programmes in the context of HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and comprehensive care services, Convinced that the Human Rights Council, in fulfilling its responsibility for promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner, has an important role to play in the area of mental health and human rights, to foster constructive international dialogue and cooperation, and to promote human rights education and learning, and also advisory services, technical assistance, capacity-building and awareness-raising, Acknowledging the leadership of the World Health Organization in the field of health, and also the work that it has carried out to date to, inter alia, integrate a human rights perspective into mental health, and recalling the commitment of States to implement by 2030 the Organization’s comprehensive mental health action plan,    1.
