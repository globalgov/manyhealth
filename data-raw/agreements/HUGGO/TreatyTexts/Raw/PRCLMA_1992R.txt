ANNEX Proclamation on Ageing The General Assembly, Noting the unprecedented ageing of populations taking place throughout the world, Conscious that the ageing of the world's population represents an unparalleled, but urgent, policy and programme challenge to Governments, non-governmental organizations and private groups to ensure that the needs of the aged and their human resource potential are adequately addressed, Conscious also that population ageing in developing regions is proceeding much more rapidly than it occurred in the developed world, Aware that a revolutionary change in the demographic structure of societies requires a fundamental change in the way in which societies organize their affairs, Optimistic that the coming decade will see an increase in partner.ships, practical initiatives and resources devoted to ageing, Welcoming the increasing contributions of older persons to economic, social and cultural development, Welcoming also broad participation in the United Nations pro.gramme on ageing, Recognizing that ageing is a life-long process and that preparation for old age must begin in childhood and continue throughout the life cycle, Recognizing also that older persons are entitled to aspire to and attain the highest possible level of health,
Recognizing farther that with increasing age some individuals will need comprehensive community and family care, Reaffirming the International Plan of Action on Ageing, which it endorsed in its resolution 37/51 of 3 December 1982, and the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, annexed to its resolution 46/91 of 16 December 1991, Noting the many United Nations activities that address ageing in the context of development, human rights, population, employment, education, health, housing, family, disability and the advancement of women, Having considered the challenges inherent in implementing the Plan of Action,
