Implementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons: realizing the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities 
The General Assembly,  Recalling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the obligations contained in relevant human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women1 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,2  Recalling also its relevant resolutions, in particular resolution 37/52 of 3 December 1982, by which it adopted the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons,3 resolution 48/96 of 20 December 1993, by which it adopted the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, and resolution 58/132 of 22 December 2003, as well as the relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions,  Recalling further the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration,4 in September 2000 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome in September 20055 by heads of State and Government, stressing the need to promote and protect the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities, and recognizing the importance of incorporating the disability perspective in the implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits, with a view to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration,  Noting with appreciation the initiatives and actions of Governments to implement the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons, the Standard Rules and of relevant resolutions that give special attention to the questions of accessible environments and information and communication technologies, health, education and social services, employment and sustainable livelihoods, including the relevant activities of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, which reflect the strong commitment to the equalization of opportunities and to the rights of persons with disabilities and the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights by persons with disabilities, including in the context of development,  Reaffirming the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits and their respective follow-up reviews,  Noting that the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, adopted by the Second World Assembly on Ageing6, considers “older persons and disabilities” as a specific issue for policy concern,  Welcoming the progress of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities in preparing a draft text of the convention,  Acknowledging the complementary contributions of all existing international frameworks on disability,  Aware of the fact that there are at least six hundred million persons with disabilities worldwide, of whom approximately eighty per cent live in developing countries,  Recognizing the important role of the World Programme of Action in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals,  Recognizing also that the achievement of the purposes of the World Programme of Action is congruent with economic and social development, extended services provided to the whole population in the humanitarian area, the redistribution of resources and income and an improvement in the living standards of the population,  Acknowledging the important role of non-governmental organizations, particularly organizations of persons with disabilities, in the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights by persons with disabilities, and noting in this regard their work in promoting the elaboration of an international convention on the rights of disabled persons,  Noting with appreciation the important contributions of regional intergovernmental organizations and the regional commissions of the United Nations in promoting awareness and building capacities for the full participation and equality of persons with disabilities, as well as the outcome of international conferences relating to persons with disabilities,  Mindful of the need to adopt and implement effective policies and strategies in all Member States, United Nations agencies, regional intergovernmental organizations and regional commissions of the United Nations to promote the rights and the full and effective participation of persons with disabilities at all levels,  Recognizing the importance of accessibility both of the physical environment and of information and communication in enabling persons with disabilities to enjoy fully their human rights and play an active part in the development of society,  Reiterating that technology, in particular information and communication technologies, provides new possibilities for improving accessibility and employment for persons with disabilities and for facilitating their full and effective participation and equality, and stressing in this regard the importance of enhancing cooperation among countries for the transfer of technology and technical and economic cooperation in the development and dissemination of appropriate disability-related technologies and know-how and welcoming the initiatives of the United Nations and contributions from regional groups in promoting information and communication technologies as a means of achieving the universal goal of a society for all,  Recognizing the importance of timely and reliable data on disability-sensitive topics, programme planning and evaluation and the need for the further development of practical statistical methodology for the collection and compilation of data on populations with disabilities, and welcoming the initiatives of various United Nations agencies and regional groups in the area of collection of disability-related data and information,  Recognizing also the need to address the challenge of better incorporating the disability perspective in development and technical cooperation activities,  Recognizing further the need to improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities worldwide through the enhancement of awareness of and sensitivity to disability issues and respect for the full enjoyment of all human rights by persons with disabilities and by ensuring that the benefits of development programmes also reach them,  Recognizing that because the vast majority of persons with disabilities continue to be excluded from the benefits of development and denied the full and equal recognition and enjoyment of their human rights, the impact of poverty on the conditions of persons with disabilities, especially in rural areas, should be given prominent consideration in the elaboration of national and international development strategies,  Expressing grave concern that situations of armed conflict continue to have especially devastating consequences for the human rights of persons with disabilities,

 9. Stresses the importance of improving data and statistics on persons with disabilities, in compliance with national legislation on the protection of personal data, so that they can be compared internationally and domestically for purposes of policy design, planning and evaluation from the disability perspective, urges Governments, in this regard, to cooperate with the Statistics Division of the Secretariat in the continuing development of global statistics and indicators on disability, and encourages them to avail themselves of the technical assistance of the Division to build national capacities for national data-collection systems;

 13. Encourages Governments, intergovernmental organizations, concerned non-governmental organizations and the private sector to continue to support the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Disability, with a view to strengthening its capacity to support catalytic and innovative activities to implement fully the World Programme of Action and the Standard Rules, including the work of the Special Rapporteur, and to support activities to build national capacities, with emphasis on priorities for action identified in the present resolution;
