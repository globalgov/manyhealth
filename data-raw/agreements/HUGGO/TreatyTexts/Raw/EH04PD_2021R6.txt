World report on disability. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2011 (available at: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/world-report-on-disability, accessed 17 January 2021). Recalling also the endorsement of the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health2 in 2001; Welcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities in the work of the United Nations, and noting with appreciation the launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, which provides the foundation for sustainable and transformative progress on disability inclusion through the work of the United Nations; Recognizing that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by public health emergencies, including pandemics such as COVID-19, and thus welcoming the specific guidance presented by the United Nations and WHO to advise relevant stakeholders on ways to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on persons with disabilities; Recognizing also the need to include the experiences and perspectives of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations in all issues, including by taking steps to ensure and actively facilitate their meaningful participation in programmes, policy and decision-making processes; Noting that globally one in seven persons experience some form of disability and that this number continues to increase owing to many underlying factors such as population ageing and the rise in the prevalence of chronic health conditions;3 Noting also the persisting attitudinal, institutional and environmental barriers, including discriminatory attitudes towards disability and inaccessible communities; Also noting, with concern, that persons with disabilities face persistent inequality in social, economic, health and political spheres, and thus are more likely to live in poverty than persons without disabilities; and that they are more likely to have risk factors for noncommunicable diseases; as well as being more likely to be unable to get access to essential health services, public health functions, medicines and treatment, due to environmental, financial, legal and attitudinal barriers in society, including discrimination and stigmatization, as well as lack of reliable and comparable data; Further noting that, as many persons with disabilities face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and are therefore at greater risk of having unmet health needs, health and rehabilitation interventions should take into account different needs and be age-sensitive and gender-responsive while promoting, protecting and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and promoting respect for their inherent dignity; Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, complex humanitarian emergencies and in the occurrence of natural disasters and their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian assistance, and recognizing the need for psychosocial support to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters; Noting that many persons with disabilities, particularly girls and women, face barriers to access information and education, including with regard to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences; Noting also the urgent need to increase the availability of disaggregated data by disability in the health sector, and in other sectors using internationally comparable high-quality disability data collection methods, in order to inform evidence-based health policies and programmes that are disability inclusive and meet the needs of persons with disabilities; Noting further that persons with disabilities are an underrepresented group in health research, and that this in turn limits the application of research findings for their benefit; Also noting that enabling universal access to assistive technology and rehabilitation services promotes the inclusion, participation and engagement of persons with disabilities in all areas of society; Highlighting the role of community health workers in advancing equitable access of persons with disabilities to safe, quality, accessible, inclusive and innovative health services in urban and rural areas and in reducing inequities; Stressing that disability-sensitive, quality, basic and continued education and training of health professionals, including effective communication skills, are crucial to ensure that they have the adequate professional skills and competencies in their respective roles and functions, to provide safe, quality, accessible and inclusive health services; Stressing also that accessible health facilities, accessible health-related information and disability-specific health services and solutions are essential for persons with disabilities to benefit equally from health education, promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation; and stressing further that technological solutions could be an effective means to enhance accessibility; Underscoring that the health needs of persons with disabilities need to be met across the life course, through comprehensive preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative services and palliative care, including psychosocial support; Reaffirming that health services should be provided to persons with disabilities on the basis of free and informed consent, and emphasizing that the necessary information to exercise such consent must be transmitted in a reasonable, accessible and understandable manner, to the extent possible, 1.
