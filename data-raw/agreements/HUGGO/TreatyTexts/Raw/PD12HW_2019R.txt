Political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage    The General Assembly  Adopts the following political declaration approved by the high-level meeting on universal health coverage on 23 September 2019:     Political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage     Universal health coverage: moving together to build a healthier world   We, Heads of State and Government and representatives of States and Governments, assembled at the United Nations on 23 September 2019, with a dedicated focus for the first time on universal health coverage, reaffirm that health is a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,1  and strongly recommit to achieve universal health coverage by 2030, with a view to scaling up the global effort to build a healthier world for all, and in this regard we:  1  Resolution 70/1.  1. Reaffirm the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health;   2. Reaffirm General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, stressing the need for a comprehensive and people-centred approach, with a view to leaving no one behind, reaching the furthest behind first, and the importance of health across all the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which are integrated and indivisible;   3. Reaffirm General Assembly resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which reaffirmed strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity;   4. Reaffirm the strong commitments made through the political declarations adopted at the high-level meetings on ending AIDS,2  on tackling antimicrobial resistance,3  on ending tuberculosis4  and on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,5 as well as the General Assembly resolutions entitled “Consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, by 2030”;6   2  Resolution 70/266, annex.  3  Resolution 71/3.  4  Resolution 73/3.  5  Resolution 73/2.  6  Resolutions 70/300 and 73/337. 7 See World Health Organization, document WHA72/2019/REC/1.  5. Recognize that universal health coverage is fundamental for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related not only to health and well-being, but also to eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, ensuring quality education, achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment, providing decent work and economic growth, reducing inequalities, ensuring just, peaceful and inclusive societies and to building and fostering partnerships, while reaching the goals and targets included throughout the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is critical for the attainment of healthy lives and well-being for all, with a focus on health outcomes throughout the life course;   6. Reaffirm the importance of national ownership and the primary role and responsibility of governments at all levels to determine their own path towards achieving universal health coverage, in accordance with national contexts and priorities, and underscore the importance of political leadership for universal health coverage beyond the health sector in order to pursue whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches, as well as health-in-all-policies approaches, equity-based approaches and life-course approaches;  7. Recall World Health Assembly resolution 72.4 of 24 May 2019, entitled “Preparation for the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on universal health coverage”;7   8. Recognize that health is an investment in human capital and social and economic development, towards the full realization of human potential, and significantly contributes to the promotion and protection of human rights and dignity as well as the empowerment of all people;   9. Recognize that universal health coverage implies that all people have access, without discrimination, to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative essential health services, and essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and vaccines, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the users to financial hardship, with a special emphasis on the poor, vulnerable and marginalized segments of the population;   10. Recognize the need for health systems that are strong, resilient, functional, well governed, responsive, accountable, integrated, community-based, people-centred and capable of quality service delivery, supported by a competent health workforce, adequate health infrastructure, enabling legislative and regulatory frameworks as well as sufficient and sustainable funding;   11. Recognize the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities within and among countries through political commitment, policies and international cooperation, including those that address social, economic and environmental and other determinants of health;   12. Recognize that action to achieve universal health coverage by 2030 is inadequate and that the level of progress and investment to date is insufficient to meet target 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, and that the world has yet to fulfil its promise of implementing, at all levels, measures to address the health needs of all, noting that:   (a) At least half of the world’s population lacks access to essential health services, more than 800 million people bear the burden of catastrophic spending of at least 10 per cent of their household income on health care, and out-of-pocket expenses drive almost 100 million people into poverty each year;   (b) At the current pace, up to one third of the world’s population will remain underserved by 2030 and a measurable acceleration is urgently needed to reach the health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030;   (c) Despite major health gains over the past decades, including increased life expectancy, the reduction of maternal and under-5 mortality rates and successful campaigns against major diseases, challenges remain with regard to emerging and re-emerging diseases, non-communicable diseases, mental disorders and other mental health conditions, as well as neurological disorders, communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and antimicrobial resistance, noting that non-communicable diseases account for over 70 per cent of all deaths in the 30–69 age group;   (d) Despite the progress achieved at the global level, many health systems are not sufficiently prepared to respond to the needs of the rapidly ageing population;   (e) The high prices of some health products, and inequitable access to such products within and among countries, as well as financial hardships associated with high prices of health products, continue to impede progress towards achieving universal health coverage;   13. Recognize that primary health care brings people into first contact with the health system and is the most inclusive, effective and efficient approach to enhance people’s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being, and that primary health care is the cornerstone of a sustainable health system for universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals, as was declared in the Declaration of Alma-Ata and reaffirmed in the Declaration of Astana;   14. Recognize the fundamental importance of equity, social justice and social protection mechanisms as well as the elimination of the root causes of discrimination and stigma in health-care settings to ensure universal and equitable access to quality health services without financial hardship for all people, particularly for those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations;  15. Recognize the consequence of the adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, extreme weather events as well as other environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, safe drinking water, sanitation, safe, sufficient and nutritious food and secure shelter, for health and in this regard underscore the need to foster health in climate change adaptation efforts, underlining that resilient and people-centred health systems are necessary to protect the health of all people, in particular those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, particularly those living in small island developing States;  16. Recognize that food security and food safety, adequate nutrition and sustainable, resilient and diverse nutrition-sensitive food systems are important elements for healthier populations;   17. Note that the increasing number of complex emergencies is hindering the achievement of universal health coverage and that coherent and inclusive approaches to safeguard universal health coverage in emergencies are essential, including through international cooperation, ensuring the continuum and provision of essential health services and public health functions, in line with humanitarian principles;  18. Recognize the need for strong global, regional and national partnerships for Sustainable Development Goals, which engage all relevant stakeholders to collaboratively support the efforts of Member States to achieve health-related Sustainable Development Goals, including universal health coverage;   19. Recognize that the world spends 7.5 trillion United States dollars on health, which is close to 10 per cent of global gross domestic product, but that the allocation of public and external funds on health worldwide is disproportionate, considering that:   (a) On average, one third of national health expenditure is covered by out-of-pocket expenses, while less than 40 per cent of funding on primary health care is from public sources in low- and middle-income countries;   (b) External funding represents less than 1 per cent of global health expenditure and there are important funding gaps given existing health needs, whereas low-income countries still rely on aid, which accounts for about 30 per cent of national health spending;   20. Recognize that people’s engagement, particularly of women and girls, families and communities, and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders is one of the core components of health system governance, to fully empower all people in improving and protecting their own health, giving due regard to addressing and managing conflicts of interest and undue influence, contributing to the achievement of universal health coverage for all, with a focus on health outcomes;   21. Recognize the vital importance of strengthening legislative and regulatory frameworks and institutions for the achievement of universal health coverage;   22. Recognize that fighting corruption at all levels and in all its forms is a priority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty eradication and sustainable development, which may undermine efforts to achieve universal health coverage;  23. Express concern at the global shortfall of 18 million health workers, primarily in low- and middle-income countries, and recognize the need to train, build and retain a skilled health workforce, including nurses, midwives and community health workers, who are an important element of strong and resilient health systems, and further recognize that increased investment in a more effective and socially accountable health workforce can unleash significant socioeconomic gains and contribute to the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, empowerment of all women and girls and reduction of inequality;   We therefore commit to scale up our efforts and further implement the following actions:  24. Accelerate efforts towards the achievement of universal health coverage by 2030 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all throughout the life course, and in this regard re-emphasize our resolve:  (a) To progressively cover 1 billion additional people by 2023 with quality essential health services and quality, safe, effective, affordable and essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and health technologies, with a view to covering all people by 2030;   (b) To stop the rise and reverse the trend of catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure by providing measures to ensure financial risk protection and eliminate impoverishment due to health-related expenses by 2030, with special emphasis on the poor as well as those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations;   25. Implement the most effective, high-impact, quality-assured, people-centred, gender- and disability-responsive and evidence-based interventions to meet the health needs of all throughout the life course, and in particular those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, ensuring universal access to nationally determined sets of integrated quality health services at all levels of care for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care in a timely manner;   26. Implement high-impact policies to protect people’s health and comprehensively address social, economic and environmental and other determinants of health by working across all sectors through a whole-of-government and health-in-all-policies approach;   27. Prioritize health promotion and disease prevention, through public health policies, good governance of health systems, education, health communication and health literacy, as well as safe, healthy and resilient cities, enabling people, throughout their life course, including, among others, adolescents, to have increased knowledge to take informed health decisions and improve health-seeking behaviour;  28. Take multisectoral action to promote active and healthy lifestyles, including physical activity for the benefit of all people throughout their life course, and ensure a world free from malnutrition in all its forms, where all people are empowered to take responsibility for their own health, supported by public regulatory measures, and have access to safe drinking water and sanitation and safe, sufficient and nutritious food and enjoy diversified, balanced and healthy diets throughout their life course, with special emphasis to the nutrition needs of pregnant and lactating women, women of reproductive age and adolescent girls, and of infants and young children, especially during the first 1,000 days, including, as appropriate, through exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months, with continued breastfeeding to 2 years of age or beyond, with appropriate complementary feeding;   29. Take measures to reduce maternal, neonatal, infant and child mortality and morbidity and increase access to quality health-care services for newborns, infants and children, as well as all women before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth;  30. Scale up efforts to promote healthy and active ageing, maintain and improve quality of life of older persons and to respond to the needs of the rapidly ageing population, especially the need for promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care as well as specialized care and the sustainable provision of long-term care, taking into account national contexts and priorities;  31. Strengthen public health surveillance and data systems, improve routine immunization and vaccination capacities, including by providing evidence-based information on countering vaccine hesitancy, and expand vaccine coverage to prevent outbreaks as well as the spread and re-emergence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, including for vaccine-preventable diseases already eliminated as well as for ongoing eradication efforts, such as for poliomyelitis;   32. Strengthen efforts to address communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and hepatitis, as part of universal health coverage and to ensure that the fragile gains are sustained and expanded by advancing comprehensive approaches and integrated service delivery and ensuring that no one is left behind;  33. Further strengthen efforts to address non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, as part of universal health coverage;   34. Strengthen efforts to address eye health conditions and oral health, as well as rare diseases and neglected tropical diseases, as part of universal health coverage;   35. Scale up efforts to address the growing burden of injuries and deaths, including those related to road traffic accidents and drowning, through preventive measures as well as strengthening trauma and emergency care systems, including essential surgery capacities, as an essential part of integrated health-care delivery;   36. Implement measures to promote and improve mental health and well-being as an essential component of universal health coverage, including by scaling up comprehensive and integrated services for prevention, including suicide prevention, as well as treatment for people with mental disorders and other mental health conditions as well as neurological disorders, providing psychosocial support, promoting well-being, strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, addressing social determinants and other health needs, and fully respecting their human rights, noting that mental disorders and other mental health conditions as well as neurological disorders are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the non-communicable diseases burden worldwide;   37. Increase access to health services for all persons with disabilities, remove physical, attitudinal, social, structural and financial barriers, provide quality standard of care and scale up efforts for their empowerment and inclusion, noting that persons with disabilities, who represent 15 per cent of the global population, continue to experience unmet health needs;   38. Scale up efforts to promote healthier and safer workplaces and improve access to occupational health services, noting that more than 2 million people die every year from preventable occupational diseases and injuries;   39. Pursue efficient health financing policies, including through close collaboration among relevant authorities, including finance and health authorities, to respond to unmet needs and to eliminate financial barriers to access to quality, safe, effective, affordable and essential health services, medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and health technologies, reduce out-of-pocket expenditures leading to financial hardship and ensure financial risk protection for all throughout the life course, especially for the poor and those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, through better allocation and use of resources, with adequate financing for primary health care, in accordance with national contexts and priorities;   40.

Expand quality essential health services, strengthen health systems and mobilize resources in health and other health-related Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries, noting that, according to World Health Organization estimates, an additional 3.9 trillion dollars in total by 2030 could prevent 97 million premature deaths and add between 3.1 and 8.4 years of life expectancy in low- and middle-income countries;   43. Optimize budgetary allocations on health, sufficiently broaden fiscal space, and prioritize health in public spending, with the focus on universal health coverage, while ensuring fiscal sustainability, and in this regard encourage countries to review whether public health expenditure is adequate to ensure sufficiency and efficiency of public spending on health and, based on such review, to adequately increase public spending, as necessary, with a special emphasis on primary health care, where appropriate, in accordance with national contexts and priorities, while noting the World Health Organization recommended target of an additional 1 per cent of gross domestic product or more;   44. Promote and implement policy, legislative and regulatory measures, including fiscal measures as appropriate, aiming at minimizing the impact of the main risk factors for non-communicable diseases, and promote healthy diets and lifestyles, consistent with national policies, noting that price and tax measures can be an effective means to reduce consumption and related health-care costs and represent a potential revenue stream for financing for development in many countries;   45. Provide adequate, predictable, evidence-based and sustainable finances, while improving their effectiveness, to support national efforts in achieving universal health coverage, in accordance with national contexts and priorities, through domestic, bilateral, regional and multilateral channels, including international cooperation, financial and technical assistance, considering the use of traditional and innovative financing mechanisms such as, inter alia, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents and the United Nations trust fund for human security, within their respective mandates, as well as partnerships with the private sector and other relevant stakeholders, recognizing that health financing requires global solidarity and collective effort;   46.
