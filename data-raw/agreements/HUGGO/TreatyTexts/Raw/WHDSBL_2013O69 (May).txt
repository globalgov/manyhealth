Further recalling that, according to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others; Recognizing the responsibility of Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure equal access to health services and care for persons with disabilities ideally through universal health coverage; Recognizing that people with disabilities have the same need for general health care as non-disabled people, yet have been shown to receive poorer treatment from health care systems than non-disabled people; Recognizing the important role that formal and informal caregivers play in supporting persons with disabilities and that, although informal caregivers cannot replace the role of the national and local authorities, they do need particular attention from the authorities to help them with their tasks, and noting that both formal and informal caregivers’ role is increasing in the context of the sustainability of health systems and the ageing of the population; Acknowledging that providing universal access to health care and health services is an investment for society; Also recognizing the extensive unmet needs for habilitation and rehabilitation services, which are vital to enable many people with a broad range of disabilities to participate in education, the labour market, and civic life, and, further, that measures to promote the health of people with disabilities and their inclusion in society through general and specialized health services are as important as measures to prevent people developing health conditions associated with disability; Acknowledging that a comprehensive multisectoral approach is required to meet the multiple barriers faced by persons with disabilities and that mainstreaming disability in development is the most efficient and cost-effective way of meeting the needs of people with disabilities; Welcoming the work of WHO’s Task Force on Disability to raise awareness of disability as a cross-cutting issue in WHO’s technical work, and in removing physical, information and policy barriers to the participation of people with disabilities in WHO’s work, 1. ENDORSES the recommendations of the World report on disability, which offer strategies for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
