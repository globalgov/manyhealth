EB61.R28 Review of the medium-term programme for mental health The Executive Board, Having considered the review by the Director-General of the process by which the medium-term programme for mental health was developed. Noting that this programme arose out of agreements between and among countries and WHO about activities to be undertaken in a given time period, and believing that early involvement of national bodies in medium-term programming is highly desirable; Finding the establishment of groups at national, regional and global level to provide coordination in both planning and implementation of the programme to be an effective approach, contributing inter alia to multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration which is of particular importance in the field of mental health. Noting with satisfaction the new public health orientation of mental health activities being actively promoted by the Director-General through this programme; Further noting the prompt response by the Director-General within the framework of the medium-term programme to stimulate cooperation between Member States as requested in resolution WHA30.45, concerning the special programme of technical cooperation in mental health, and to make Member States in southern Africa an early focus of action.
1. CONGRATULATES the Director-General on the preparation of the medium-term programme for mental health; 2. INVITES Member States to continue to cooperate closely in the formulation, continuing adjustment and implementation of the programme. 3. REQUESTS the Director-General : (1) to transmit his review together with the comments of the Executive Board and relevant information on current activities in the programme to the Thirty-first World Health Assembly; (2) to continue implementation of the programme; (3) to report on further experience with development of the programme to the Programme Committee of the Executive Board not later than 1980. Hbk Res., Vol. II (2nd ed.), 1.9.5 Twenty-first meeting.24 January 1978
