physical inactivity and environmental carcinogens, being aware that these risk factors have economic, social, gender, political, behavioural and environmental determinants, and in this regard stressing the need for a multisectoral response to combat non-communicable diseases, Underscoring the need for concerted action and a coordinated response at the national, regional and global levels in order to adequately address the developmental and other challenges posed by non-communicable diseases, in particular the four most prominent non-communicable diseases, namely, cardiovascular

millions of people throughout the world, the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including access to medicines, still remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal is becoming increasingly remote, Underscoring the fact that global health is also a long-term developmental objective which is local, national, regional and international in scope and requires sustained attention, commitment and closer international cooperation, and in this regard reaffirming the need to further strengthen international cooperation in the area of public health, inter alia, through the exchange of best practices aimed at building the capacity of public health systems, providing financial

infrastructure and the transfer of technology, Reaffirming the commitment to strengthening national health systems that deliver equitable health outcomes as the basis of a comprehensive approach,

Woods institutions, the private sector and civil society, and the mass media, in the promotion of public health at all levels,  Recognizing also the enormous human suffering caused by non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, and the threat they pose to the economies of many Member States, leading to increasing inequalities between countries and populations, thereby threatening the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, Noting the call to consider integrating indicators to monitor the magnitude, the trend and the socio-economic impact of non-communicable diseases into the Millennium Development Goals monitoring system, Recognizing the lack of sufficient statistical data on non-communicable diseases, particularly in developing countries, and the need for the development and wide utilization of a set of standardized indicators for data collection and information on trends in respect of non-communicable diseases and their risk factors at the global, regional and national levels, Convinced of the urgent need to undertake multilateral efforts at the highest political level to address the rising prevalence, morbidity and mortality of non-communicable diseases worldwide and to raise the priority accorded to non-communicable diseases in development cooperation by enhancing such cooperation in this regard, 1. Decides to convene a high-level meeting of the General Assembly in September 2011, with the
