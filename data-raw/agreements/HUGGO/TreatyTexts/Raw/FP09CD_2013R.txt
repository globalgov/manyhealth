To promote and support national capacityfor high-qualityresearchand development for the prevention and control ofnoncommunicable diseases. 6. To monitor the trends and determinants ofnoncommunicable diseases and evaluate progress intheir prevention and control.  Voluntary global targets  (1) A25% relative reductioninthe overall mortality fromcardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratorydiseases (2) At least 10% relative reductioninthe harmful use ofalcohol, as appropriate, withinthe national context (3) A10% relative reductioninprevalence ofinsufficient physical activity (4) A30% relative reductionin meanpopulationintake ofsalt/sodium (5) A30% relative reductioninprevalence ofcurrent tobacco use inpersons aged 15+ years (6) A25% relative reductioninthe prevalence ofraised blood pressure or containthe prevalence ofraised blood pressure, accordingto national circumstances (7) Halt the rise indiabetes and obesity (8) At least 50% ofeligible people receive drugtherapyand counselling(includingglycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes (9) An 80% availabilityofthe affordablebasic technologies and essential medicines, includinggenerics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseasesinbothpublic and private facilities  Background 1. The global burden and threat of noncommunicable diseases constitutes a major public health challenge that undermines social and economic development throughout the world. Strong leadership and urgent action are required at the global, regional and national levels to mitigate them, which inter alia has the effect ofincreasinginequalities between countries and withinpopulations. 2. An estimated36 million deaths, or 63% of the 57 million deaths that occurredgloballyin 2008, were due to noncommunicable diseases, comprising mainly cardiovascular diseases (48% of noncommunicable diseases), cancers (21%), chronic respiratorydiseases (12%) anddiabetes (3.5%).1,2 These major noncommunicable diseases share four behavioural risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol. In 2008, 80% of all deaths (29 million) from noncommunicable diseases occurred in low-and middle-income countries, and a higher proportion (48%) of the deaths in the latter countries are premature (under the age of 70) compared to high-income countries (26%). Although morbidity and mortality from noncommunicable diseases mainly occur in adulthood, exposure to riskfactors begins in earlylife. Children can die fromtreatable noncommunicable diseases, such asrheumatic heartdisease, type 1diabetes,asthma, andleukaemia, if health promotion, disease prevention, and comprehensive care are not provided. According to WHO’s projections, the total annual number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases will increase to 55 million by 2030, if “business as usual” continues. Scientific knowledge demonstrates that the noncommunicable disease burden can be greatly reduced if cost-effective preventive and curative actions and interventions for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases already available, areimplementedinan effective andbalanced manner. Aim 3. As requested by the World Health Assembly in resolution WHA64.11, the Secretariat has developed a global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases for the period 2013–2020, building on what has already been achieved through the implementation of the 2008–2013 action plan. Its aimis to operationalize the commitments of the PoliticalDeclaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases.3 Process 4. The global and regional consultation process to develop the action plan engagedWHOMember States, relevant United Nations system agencies, funds and programmes, international financial institutions, development banks and other key international organizations, health professionals, academia, civil society and the private sector through regional meetings organized by the six WHO regional offices, four web consultations which received 325 written submissions, three informal consultations with Member States and two informal dialogues with relevant nongovernmental organizationsand selectedprivatesector entities. 1http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/cod_2008_sources_methods.pdf. 2 GlobalStatusReportonnoncommunicablediseases2010,Geneva, WorldHealthOrganization,2010. 3UnitedNations GeneralAssemblyresolution66/2(http://www.who.int/nmh/events/un_ncd_summit2011/ political_declaration_en.pdf). Scope 5. The action plan provides a road map and a menu of policy options for all Member States and other stakeholders, to take coordinated and coherent action, at all levels, local to global, to attain the nine voluntary global targets, including that of a 25% relative reduction in premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases,cancer,diabetes or chronicrespiratorydiseases by2025. 6. The main focus of this action plan is on four types of noncommunicable disease – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – which make the largest contribution to morbidity and mortality due to noncommunicable diseases, and on four shared behavioural risk factors – tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol. It recognizes that the conditions in which people live and work and their lifestyles influence their health andquality oflife. There are many other conditions ofpublic healthimportance that are closely associated with the four major noncommunicable diseases. They include: (i) other noncommunicable diseases (renal, endocrine, neurological, haematological, gastroenterological, hepatic, musculoskeletal, skin and oral diseases, and genetic disorders); (ii) mental disorders; (iii)disabilities, including blindness and deafness; and (iv) violence and injuries (Appendix 1). Noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors also have strategic links to health systems and universal health coverage, environmental, occupational and social determinants of health, communicable diseases, maternal, child and adolescent health, reproductive health and ageing. Despite the close links, one action plan to address all of them in equal detail would be unwieldy. Further, some of these conditions are the subject of other WHO strategies and action plans or HealthAssembly resolutions. Appendix 1outlines potential synergies and linkages between major noncommunicable diseases and lists some of the interrelated conditions, to emphasize opportunities for collaboration so as to maximize efficiencies for mutual benefit. Linking the action plan in this manner also reflects WHO’s responsiveness to the organization’s reformagenda asitrelatesto workingin amore cohesive andintegrated manner. 7. Using current scientific knowledge, available evidence and a review of experience on prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, the action plan proposes a menu of policy options for Member States, international partners and the Secretariat, under six interconnected and mutually reinforcing objectives involving: (i)international cooperation and advocacy; (ii) country-led multisectoral response; (iii) risk factors and determinants; (iv)health systems and universal health coverage;(v) research, development andinnovation; and(vi) surveillanceand monitoring. Monitoring of the action plan 8. The global monitoring framework, including 25 indicators and a set of nine voluntary global targets (see Appendix 2), will track the implementation of the action plan through monitoring and reporting on the attainment of the voluntary global targets in 2015 and 2020. The action plan is not limited in scope to the global monitoring framework. The indicators of the global monitoring framework and the voluntary global targets provide overall direction and the action plan provides a road mapfor reachingthetargets. Relationship to the calls made upon WHO and its existing strategies, reform and plans 9. Since the adoption of the global strategy for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases in 2000, severalHealthAssemblyresolutionshave been adopted or endorsedin support of the key components of the global strategy. This action plan builds on the implementation of those resolutions, mutually reinforcing them. They include the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control(WHOFCTC)(resolution WHA56.1), the Global strategy on diet, physical activity andhealth (resolution WHA57.17), the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol (resolution WHA63.13), Sustainable health financing structures and universal coverage (resolution WHA64.9) and the Global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property (resolution WHA61.21). Also relevant are the Outcome of the World Conference on Social Determinants of Health (resolution WHA65.8) and the Moscow Declaration of the First Global Ministerial Conference on Healthy Lifestyles and Noncommunicable Disease Control (resolution WHA64.11). The action plan also provides a framework to support and strengthen implementation of existing regional resolutions, frameworks, strategies and plans on prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases including AFR/RC62/WP/7, CSP28.R13, EMR/CR59/R2, EUR/RC61/R3, SEA/RC65/R5, WPR/RC62.R2. It has close conceptual and strategic links to the comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–20201 and the action plan for the prevention of avoidable blindness and visual impairment 2014–2019,2 which will be considered by the Sixty-sixth WorldHealthAssembly. The action plan will also be guidedbyWHO’s twelfthgeneralprogramme of work(2014–2019).3 10. The action plan is consistent with WHO’s reform agenda, which requires the Organization to engage an increasing number of public health actors, including foundations, civil society organizations, partnerships and the private sector, in work related to the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. The roles and responsibilities of the three levels of the Secretariat – country offices, regional offices and headquarters – in the implementation of the action plan will be reflectedintheorganization-wide workplans tobe setout in WHOprogramme budgets. 11. Over the 2013–2020 time period other plans with close linkages to noncommunicable diseases (such as the action plan on disability called for in resolution EB132.R5) may be developed and will need to be synchronized with this action plan. Further, flexibility is required for updating Appendix 3 of this action plan periodically in light of new scientific evidence. Flexibility will also be needed for reorienting parts of the action plan, as appropriate, through the governing bodies, in response to the post-2015UnitedNations development agenda. Cost of action versus inaction 12. For all countries, the cost ofinaction far outweighs the cost of taking action on noncommunicable diseases as recommended in this action plan. There are interventions for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases which give a good return on investment, generating one year of healthy life for a cost that falls below the gross domestic product (GDP) per person and are affordable for all countries4 (see Appendix 3). The total cost of implementing a combination of very cost-effective population-wide and individual interventions, in terms of current health spending, amounts to 4% in low-income countries, 2% in lower middle-income countries and less than 1% in upper middle-income and high-income countries. The cost of implementing the action plan by the Secretariat is estimated at US$940.26 million for the eight-year period2013–2020. The above estimates for implementation of the action plan should be viewed against the cost of inaction. Continuing “business as usual” will result in lossofproductivityandanescalationofhealthcarecostsinallcountries.Thecumulativeoutputlossdue to the four major noncommunicable diseases together with mental disorders is estimated to be 1http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB132/B132_8-en.pdf. 2http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB132/B132_9-en.pdf. 3http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB132/B132_26-en.pdf. 4Scalingup actionagainst noncommunicable disease: how much willit cost?Geneva, WorldHealthOrganization, 2011http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241502313_eng.pdf. US$47trillion. This loss represents 75% of global GDP in 2010 (US$ 63 trillion).1 This action plan should also be seen as an investment prospect, because it provides direction and opportunities for all countries to (i)safeguard the health and productivity of populations and economies; (ii)make informed decisions and choices related to, inter alia, food, media, information and communication technology, sports and health insurance; and (iii) identify the potential for new, replicable and scalable innovations thatcanbeappliedgloballytoreduceburgeoninghealthcarecostsinallcountries. Adaptation of framework to regional and national contexts 13. The framework provided in this action plan needs to be adapted at the regional and national levels, taking into account region-specific situations and in accordance with national legislation and priorities and specific national circumstances. There is no single formulation of an action plan that fits all countries, as they are at different points in their progress in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and at different levels of socioeconomic development. However, all countries can benefit from the comprehensive response to the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases presented in this action plan. There are cost-effective interventions and policy options across the six objectives (see Appendix 3), which, if implemented to scale, would enable all countries to make significant progress in attaining the nine voluntaryglobal targets by2025 (see Appendix 2). The exact manner in which sustainable national scale-up can be undertaken varies by country, being affectedby each country’s level of socioeconomic development, degree of enabling political andlegal climate, characteristics of the noncommunicable disease burden, competing national public health priorities, budgetary allocations for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, degree of universality of health coverage and health system strengthening, type of health system(e.g. centralized ordecentralized) and nationalcapacity. Global coordination mechanism 14. The Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases reaffirms the leadership and coordination role of the World Health Organization in promoting and monitoring global action against noncommunicable diseases in relation to the work of other relevant United Nations system agencies, development banks and other regional and international organizations. In consultation with Member States, the WHO Secretariat plans to develop a global mechanism to coordinate the activities of the United Nations system and promote engagement, international cooperation, collaboration and accountability among allstakeholders. 15. The purpose of the proposed global mechanism is to improve coordination of activities which address functional gaps that are barriers to the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. Theglobalcoordination mechanismis to be developedbasedon the followingparameters: • The mechanism shall be convened, hosted and led by WHO and report to the WHO governingbodies. • The primary role and responsibility for preventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases lie with governments, while efforts and engagement of all sectors of society, international collaborationand cooperation areessentialfor success. 1 Theglobaleconomicburdenofnoncommunicablediseases.WorldEconomic ForumandHarvardSchoolofPublic Health, 2011. • The global mechanism will facilitate engagement among Member States,1 United Nations funds, programmes and agencies, and other international partners,2 and non-State actors,3 while safeguarding WHO and public health from any form of real, perceived or potential conflictsofinterest. • The engagement with non-State Actors3 will follow the relevant rules currently being negotiated as part ofWHO reformand to be considered, through the Executive Board, by the Sixty-seventhWorldHealthAssembly. Vision 16. Aworldfree oftheavoidable burdenof noncommunicablediseases. Goal 17. To reduce the preventable and avoidable burden of morbidity, mortality and disability due to noncommunicable diseases by means of multisectoral collaboration and cooperation at national, regional and global levels, so that populations reach the highest attainable standards of health, quality of life, and productivity at every age and those diseases are no longer a barrier to well-being or socioeconomic development. Overarching principles and approaches 18. Theaction plan relieson the followingoverarchingprinciplesand approaches: • Human rights approach: It shouldbe recognized thatthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being, without distinction of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birthor other status, asenshrinedin the UniversalDeclarationofHuman Rights.4 • Equity-based approach: It should be recognized that the unequal burden of noncommunicable diseases is influenced by the social determinants of health, and that action on these determinants, both for vulnerable groups and the entire population, is essential to reduce the overall burden of noncommunicable diseases and create inclusive, equitable, economicallyproductive andhealthysocieties. • National action and international cooperation and solidarity: The primary role and responsibility of governments in responding to the challenge of noncommunicable diseases 1And, where applicable, regionaleconomic integration organizations. 2Withoutprejudice to ongoingdiscussionson WHO engagement with non-State actors, internationalpartners are definedfor thispurpose as publichealth agencies with an international mandate, internationaldevelopment agencies, intergovernmental organizations includingother UnitedNations organizations andglobalhealthinitiatives, international financialinstitutions includingthe WorldBank, foundations, andnongovernmental organizations. 3Non-State actors include academia and relevant nongovernmental organizations, as well as selectedprivate sector entities, as appropriate, excludingthe tobacco industry, andincludingthose that are demonstrablycommitted topromoting public health andare willingtoparticipateinpublic reportingandaccountabilityframeworks. 4The UniversalDeclaration ofHuman Rights http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml. should be recognized, together with the important role of international cooperation in assistingMember States, asacomplement to national efforts. • Multisectoral action: It should be recognized that effective noncommunicable disease prevention and control require leadership, coordinated multistakeholder engagement and multisectoral action for health both at government level and at the level of a wide range of actors, with such engagement and action including, as appropriate, health-in-all-policies and whole-of-government approaches across sectors such as health, agriculture, communication, education, employment, energy, environment, finance, food, foreign affairs, housing, justice and security, legislature, social welfare, social and economic development, sports, tax and revenue, trade and industry, transport, urban planning and youth affairs and partnership with relevant civil societyandprivate sector entities. • Life-course approach: Opportunities to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases occur at multiple stages of life; interventions in early life often offer the best chance for primary prevention. Policies, plans and services for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases need to take account ofhealth and social needs at all stages of the life-course, starting with maternal health, including preconception, antenatal and postnatal care, maternal nutrition and reducing environmental exposures to risk factors, and continuing through proper infant feeding practices, including promotion of breastfeeding and health promotion for children, adolescents and youth followed by promotion of a healthy working life, healthyageingand care forpeople withnoncommunicablediseasesinlaterlife. • Empowerment of people and communities: People and communities should be empowered and involved in activities for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, education and training, monitoring, researchandevaluation. • Evidence-based strategies: Strategies and practices for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases need to be based on scientific evidence and/or best practice, cost-effectiveness, affordability and public health principles, taking cultural considerations intoaccount. • Universal health coverage: All people should have access, without discrimination, to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative and palliative basic health services and essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and diagnostics. At the same time it must be ensured that the use of these services does not expose the users to financial hardship, with a special emphasis on the poor and populationslivingin vulnerablesituations. • Management of real, perceived or potential conflicts of interest: Multiple actors, both State and non-State actors including civil society, academia, industry, nongovernmental and professional organizations, need to be engaged for noncommunicable diseases to be tackled effectively. Public health policies for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases must be protected from undue influence by any form of vested interest. Real, perceived orpotential conflicts ofinterest must be acknowledged andmanaged. Objective 1. To raise the priority accorded to the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases in global, regional and national agendas and internationally agreed development goals, through strengthenedinternational cooperation and advocacy 19. The Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention andControl ofNon-communicable Diseases, the outcome document of the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development1 (Rio+20) and the first report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda2 have acknowledged that addressing noncommunicable diseases is a priority for social development and investment in people. Better health outcomes from noncommunicable diseases is a precondition for, an outcome of and an indicator of all three dimensions of sustainable development: economic development, environmental sustainability, and socialinclusion. 20. Advocacy and international cooperation are vital for resource mobilization, capacity strengthening and advancing the political commitment and momentum generated by the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases. Actions listed under this objective are aimed at creating enabling environments at the global, regional and countrylevels for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. The desired outcomes of this objective are strengthened international cooperation, stronger advocacy, enhanced resources, improved capacity and creation of enabling environments to attain the nine voluntary global targets (see Appendix 2). Policy options for Member States3 21. It is proposed that, in accordance with their legislation, and as appropriate in view of their specific circumstances, Member States may select and undertake actions from among the policy options setout below. (a) Advocacy: Generate actionable evidence and disseminate information about the effectiveness of interventions or policies to intervene positively on linkages between noncommunicable diseases and sustainable development, including other related issues such as poverty alleviation, economic development, the Millennium Development Goals, sustainable cities, non-toxic environment, food security, climate change, disaster preparedness, peace and securityandgenderequality, based on national situations. (b) Broader health and development agenda: Promote universal health coverage as a means of prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, and its inclusion as a key element in the internationally agreeddevelopment goals;integrate the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases into national health-planning processes and broader development agendas, according to country context and priorities, and where relevant mobilize the United Nations Country Teams to strengthen the links among noncommunicable diseases, universal health coverage and sustainable development, integrating them into the United Nations Development Assistance Framework’s design processes andimplementation. 1UnitedNations GeneralAssemblyresolution66/288. 2www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Post_2015_UNTTreport.pdf. 3And, where applicable, regionaleconomic integration organizations. (c) Partnerships: Forge multisectoral partnerships as appropriate, to promote cooperation at all levels among governmental agencies, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, civil societyand the private sector to strengthen efforts for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. Actions for the Secretariat 22.

Also consideration of economic tools, where justified by evidence, which may include taxes and subsidies, that create incentives for behaviours associated with improvedhealth outcomes,as appropriate withinthe nationalcontext. (d) Dissemination of best practices: Promote and facilitate international and intercountry collaboration for exchange of best practices in the areas of health-in-all policies, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches, legislation, regulation, health system strengthening and training of health personnel, so as to disseminate learning from the experiencesofMember Statesin meetingthe challenges. 1http://www.who.int/nmh/events/2012/20121128.pdf(accessed22April2013). Proposed actions for international partners and the private sector 23. Without prejudice to ongoing discussions on WHO engagement with non-State actors, international partners are defined for this purpose as public health agencies with an international mandate, international development agencies, intergovernmental organizations including other United Nations organizations and global health initiatives, International financial institutions including the World Bank, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations and selected private sector entities that commit to the objectives of the action plan and including those that are demonstrably committed to promoting public health and are willing to participate in public reporting and accountability frameworks. Proposedactions include: (a) Encouraging the continued inclusion of noncommunicable diseases in development cooperation agendas and initiatives, internationally-agreed development goals, economic development policies, sustainable development frameworks andpoverty-reductionstrategies. (b) Strengthening advocacy to sustain the interest of Heads of State and Government in implementation of the commitments of the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases, for instance by strengthening capacity at global, regional and national levels, involving all relevant sectors, civil society and communities, as appropriate within the national context, with the full and active participation ofpeople livingwiththese diseases. (c) Strengthening international cooperation within the framework of North–South, South–South and triangular cooperation, in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases to: • Promote at the national, regional and international levels an enabling environment to facilitatehealthylifestylesand choices. • Support national efforts for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, inter alia, through exchange of information on best practices and dissemination of research findings in the areas of health promotion, legislation, regulation, monitoring and evaluation and health systems strengthening, building of institutional capacity, trainingofhealthpersonnel, anddevelopment of appropriatehealthcareinfrastructure. • Promote the development anddissemination of appropriate, affordable and sustainable transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms for the production of affordable, safe, effective and quality medicines and vaccines, diagnostics and medical technologies, the creation of information and electronic communication technologies (eHealth) and the use of mobile and wireless devices(mHealth). • Strengthen existing alliances and initiatives and forge new collaborative partnerships as appropriate, to strengthen capacity for adaptation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the action plan for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases at global, regional andnationallevels. (d) Support the coordinating role of WHO in areas where stakeholders – including nongovernmental organizations, professional associations, academia, research institutions and the private sector –can contribute andtake concerted action against noncommunicablediseases. (e) Support the informal collaborative arrangement among United Nations agencies, convenedbyWHOforprevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. (f) Fulfiltheofficialdevelopment assistance commitment.1 Objective 2. To strengthen national capacity, leadership, governance, multisectoral action and partnerships to accelerate country response for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 24. As the ultimate guardians of apopulation’s health, governments have the lead responsibilityfor ensuring that appropriate institutional, legal, financial and service arrangements are provided for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. 25. Noncommunicable diseases undermine the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and are contributory to poverty and hunger. Strategies to address noncommunicable diseases need to deal with health inequities which arise from the societal conditions in which people are born, grow, live and work and to mitigate barriers to childhood development, education, economic status, employment, housing and environment. Upstream policy and multisectoral action to address these socialdeterminants ofhealth willbe criticalfor achieving sustainedprogress in prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. 26. Universal health coverage, people-centred primary health care and social protection mechanisms are important tools to protect people from financialhardship related to noncommunicable diseases and to provide access to health services for all, in particular for the poorest segments of the population. Universalhealth coverage needs to be established and/or strengthened at the countrylevel, to support the sustainable prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. 27. Effective noncommunicable disease prevention and control require multisectoral approaches at the government level, including, as appropriate, a whole-of-government, whole-of-society and health-in-all policies approach across such sectors as health, agriculture, communication, customs/revenue, education, employment/labour, energy, environment, finance, food, foreign affairs, housing, industry, justice/security, legislature, social welfare, social and economic development, sports,trade, transport, urban planningandyouth affairs (Appendix 5). Approaches to be consideredto implement multisectoral action could include, inter alia, (i)self-assessment of Ministry of Health, (ii) assessment of other sectors required for multisectoral action, (iii) analyses of areas which require multisectoral action, (iv) development of engagement plans, (v) use of a framework to foster common understanding between sectors, (vi)strengthening of governance structures, political will and accountability mechanisms, (vii) enhancement of community participation, (viii) adoption of other goodpracticesto fosterintersectoralaction and(ix) monitoringand evaluation. 28. An effective national response for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases requires multistakeholder engagement, to include individuals, families and communities, intergovernmental organizations, religious institutions, civil society, academia, the media, policy-makers, voluntary associations and, where appropriate, traditional medicine practitioners the private sector and industry. The active participation of civil societyin efforts to address noncommunicable diseases, particularly the participation ofgrass-roots organizations representingpeople livingwith noncommunicable diseases and their carers, can empower society and improve accountability of public health policies, legislation and 1Document A/8124 available at http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/348/91/ IMG/NR034891.pdf. services, making them acceptable, responsive to needs and supportive in assisting individuals to reach the highest attainable standard of health and well-being. Member States can also promote change to improve social and physical environments and enable progress against noncommunicable diseases includingthrough constructive engagement withrelevant privatesectoractors. 29. The desired outcomes of this objective are strengthened stewardship and leadership, increased resources, improved capacity and creation of enabling environments for forging a collaborative multisectoral response at national level, in order to attain the nine voluntary global targets (see Appendix 2). Policy options for Member States1 30. It is proposed that, in accordance with their legislation, and as appropriate in view of their specific circumstances, Member States may select and undertake actions from among the policy options setout below. (a) Enhance governance: Integrate the prevention and control of noncommunicablediseases into health-planning processes and development plans, with special attention to social determinants of health, gender equity and the health needs of people living in vulnerable situations, including indigenous peoples, migrant populations and people with mental and psychosocialdisabilities. (b) Mobilize sustained resources: As appropriate to national context, and in coordination with the relevant organizations and ministries, including the Ministry of Finance • Strengthen the provision of adequate, predictable and sustained resources for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and for universal health coverage, through an increase in domestic budgetary allocations, voluntaryinnovative financing mechanisms and other means, including multilateral financing, bilateral sources andprivatesector and/ornongovernmental sources,and • Improve efficiency of resource utilization including through synergy of action, integratedapproachesand sharedplanningacross sectors. (c) Strengthen national noncommunicable diseases programmes: Strengthen programmes for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases with suitable expertise, resources and responsibility for needs assessment, strategic planning, policy development, legislative action, multisectoral coordination,implementation, monitoringand evaluation. (d) Conduct needs assessment and evaluation: Conduct periodic assessments of epidemiological and resource needs, including workforce, institutional and research capacity;

Thefollowingactionsare envisagedforthe Secretariat: (a) Leading and convening: Mobilize the United Nations system to work as one within the scope of bodies’ respective mandates, based on an agreed division of labour, and synergize the efforts of different United Nations organizations as per established informal collaborative arrangement among United Nations agencies in order to provide additional support to Member States. (b) Technical cooperation: Provide support to countries in evaluating and implementing evidence-based options that suit their needs and capacities andin assessing the healthimpact of public policies, including on trade, management of conflicts of interest and maximizing of intersectoral synergies for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (see Appendix 1) across programmes for environmental health, occupational health, and for addressing noncommunicable diseases during disasters and emergencies. Such support to be given by establishing/strengthening national reference centres, WHO collaborating centres and knowledge-sharingnetworks. (c) Policy guidance and dialogue: Provide guidance for countries in developing partnerships for multisectoral action to address functional gaps in the response for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, guided by the Note of the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Director-General, in particular addressing the gaps identified in that report, including advocacy, awareness-raising, accountability including management of real, perceived or potential conflicts of interest at the national level, financing and resource mobilization, capacity strengthening, technical support, product access, market shaping and product development andinnovation. (d) Knowledge generation: Develop, where appropriate, technical tools, decision support tools and information products for implementation of cost-effective interventions, for assessing the potential impact of policy choices on equity and on social determinants of health, for monitoring multisectoral action for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, for managing conflicts of interest and for communication, including through social media, tailoredto the capacityandresource availabilityof countries. (e) Capacity strengthening: • Develop a “One-WHO workplan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases” to ensure synergy and alignment of activities across the three levels of WHO, based on countryneeds. • Strengthen the capacity of the Secretariat at all levels to assist Member States to implement the action plan, recognizing the key role played by WHO Country Offices working directly with relevant national Ministries, agencies and nongovernmental organizations. • Facilitate and support capacity assessment surveys ofMember States to identify needs and tailortheprovision of support fromthe Secretariatand otheragencies. Proposed actions for international partners 32. Strengthen international cooperation within the framework of North–South, South–South and triangular cooperation, andforge collaborative partnershipsas appropriate, to: (a) Support national authorities in implementing evidence-based multisectoral action (see Appendix 5), to address functional gaps in the response to noncommunicable diseases (e.g. in the areas of advocacy, strengthening of health workforce and institutional capacity, capacity building, product development, access and innovation), in implementing existing international conventions in the areas of environment and labour and in strengthening health financing for universalhealth coverage. (b) Promote capacity-building of relevant nongovernmental organizations at the national, regional andgloballevels, in order torealize their fullpotential as partnersin theprevention and controlof noncommunicable diseases. (c) Facilitate the mobilization of adequate, predictable and sustained financial resources and the necessary human and technical resources to support the implementation of national action plansandthe monitoringand evaluationofprogress. (d) Enhance the quality of aid for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases by strengthening national ownership, alignment, harmonization, predictability, mutual accountabilityand transparency, and resultsorientation. (e) Support social mobilization to implement the action plan and to promote equity in relation to the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases including through creating and strengthening associations of people with those diseases as well as supporting families and carers, and facilitate dialogue among those groups, health workers and government authorities in health and relevant outside sectors such as the human rights, education, employment, judicial and social sectors. (f) Support national plans for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases through the exchange of best practices and bypromoting the development and dissemination of appropriate, affordableandsustainable transfer of technologyon mutuallyagreedterms. (g) Support countries and the Secretariat in implementing other actions set out in this objective. Objective 3. To reduce modifiable risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and underlying social determinants through creation of health-promoting environments 33. The Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention andControl ofNon-communicable Diseases recognizes the criticalimportance ofreducing the level of exposure of individuals and populations to the common modifiable risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, while strengthening the capacity of individuals and populations to make healthier choices and follow lifestyle patterns that foster good health. While deaths from noncommunicable diseases mainly occur in adulthood, exposure to risk factors begins in childhood and builds up throughout life, underpinning the importance of legislative and regulatory measures, as appropriate, and health promotion interventions that engage State and non-State actors1 from within and outside the health sectors, to prevent tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity and harmful use of alcohol and toprotect children fromadverse impacts ofmarketing. 34. Governments shouldbe the key stakeholders in the development of anationalpolicyframework for promoting health and reducing risk factors. At the same time, it must be recognized that the effectiveness of multisectoral action requires allocation of defined roles to other stakeholders, protection of the public interest and avoidance of any undue influence from conflicts of interest. Further, supportive environments that protect physical and mental health and promote healthy behaviour need to be created through multisectoral action (see Appendix 5), using incentives and disincentives, regulatory and fiscal measures, laws and other policy options, and health education, as appropriate within the national context, with a special focus on maternal health (including preconception, antenatal and postnatal care, and maternal nutrition), children, adolescents and youth, includingprevention ofchildhood obesity(See Appendix 1). 35. The effective implementation of actions listed under this objective will enable countries to contribute to voluntary global targets related to risk factors, as well as to the premature mortality target. It is proposed that, in accordance with their nation’s legislative, religious and cultural contexts, and in accordance with constitutional principles and international legal obligations, Member States mayselect andundertake actionsfromamongthe policyoptions set out below. Policy options for Member States:2 tobacco control 36. The proposedpolicy options aim to contribute to achieving the voluntaryglobal target of a30% relative reductionin prevalence of currenttobaccousein persons aged15 or older. Theyinclude: (a) Accelerate full implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).

To strengthen and orient health systems to address the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and the underlying social determinants through people-centred primary health care and universal health coverage 46. The Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases recognizes the importance of universal health coverage, especially through primary health care and social protection mechanisms, to provide access to health services for all, in particular, to the poorest segments of the population (paragraph45(n) of the Political Declaration of the UnitedNations GeneralAssemblyHigh-levelMeeting on the Prevention andControl of Non-communicable Diseases). For comprehensive care of noncommunicable diseases all people require access, without discrimination, to anationallydetermined set ofpromotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative basic health services. It must be ensured that the use of these services does not expose the users to financial hardship, including in cases of ensuring the continuity of care in the aftermath of emergencies and disasters. A strengthened health system directed towards addressing noncommunicable diseases should aim to improve health promotion, prevention, early detection, treatment and sustained management of people with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases (Appendix 3), in order to prevent complications, reduce the need for hospitalization and costly high-technology interventions and premature deaths. The health sector also needs to collaborate with other sectors and workin partnership toensuresocialdeterminantsareconsideredinserviceplanningandprovisionwithincommunities. 47. The actions outlined under this objective aim to strengthen the health system including the health workforce, set policydirections for moving towards universalhealth coverage and contribute to achievingthe voluntaryglobaltargets listedbelowaswellas the prematuremortalitytarget. • At least 50% of eligible people receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes • An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics,requiredtotreatmajornoncommunicablediseasesinbothpublicandprivatefacilities. • A 25% relative reduction in the prevalence of raisedbloodpressure or contain the prevalence of raisedbloodpressure, accordingto national circumstances. Policy options for Member States1 48.

Strengthen international cooperation within the framework of North–South, South–South and triangular cooperation andforge collaborative partnerships,as appropriate, to: (a) Facilitate the mobilization of adequate, predictable and sustained financial resources to advance universal coverage in national health systems, especially through primary health care further to facilitate quality and affordable secondary/tertiary health care and treatment facilities and social protection mechanisms, in order to provide access to health services for all, in particular forthe poorestsegments ofthe population. (b) Support national authorities in strengthening health systems and expanding quality service coverage including through development of appropriate health care infrastructure and institutional capacity for training of health personnel such as public health institutions, medical and nursingschools. (c) Contribute to efforts to improve access to affordable, safe, effective and quality medicines anddiagnostics and other technologies, including through the full use of trade-related aspectsofintellectualpropertyrights flexibilitiesandprovisions. (d) Support national efforts for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, inter alia through the exchange ofinformation on best practices anddissemination offindings in health systems research. Objective 5. To promote and support national capacity for high-quality research and development for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 51. Although effective interventions exist for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, their implementation is inadequate worldwide. Comparative, applied and operational research, integrating both social and biomedical sciences, is required to scale up and maximize the impact of existing interventions (see Appendix 3), in order to meet the nine voluntary global targets (see Appendix 2). 1The Secretariat will continue toimplement theITU/WHOGlobalJointProgramme on mHealth and noncommunicable diseases. 52. The Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention andControl ofNon-communicable Diseases calls uponall stakeholders to support andfacilitate research relatedtothepreventionandcontrolofnoncommunicablediseases,anditstranslationintopractice,soas to enhance the knowledge base for national, regional and global action. The global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property (WHA61.21), encourages needs-driven research to target diseases that disproportionately affect people in low-and middle-income countries, including noncommunicable diseases. WHO’s prioritized research agenda for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases drawn up through a participatory and consultative process provides guidanceonfutureinvestmentinnoncommunicablediseaseresearch.1Theagendaprioritizes(i)research for placing noncommunicable diseases in the global development agenda and for monitoring; (ii)research to understand and influence the multisectoral, macroeconomic and social determinants of noncommunicable diseases and risk factors; (iii)translation and health systems research for global application of proven cost-effective strategies; and (iv)research to enable expensive but effective interventionstobecomeaccessibleandbeappropriatelyusedinresource-constrainedsettings. Policy options for Member States2 53.

Examples of these include cognitive impairment and other noncommunicable diseases, including renal, endocrin, neurological including epilepsy, autism, Alzheimer’s andParkinson’s diseases, haematologicalincludinghaemoglobinopathies (e.g.thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia), hepatic, gastroenterological, musculoskeletal, skin and oral diseases, disabilities and genetic disorders which may affect individuals either alone or as comorbidities. The presence of these conditions may also influence the development, progression and response to treatment of major noncommunicable diseases and shouldbe addressed throughintegrated approaches. Further, conditions such as kidney disease result from lack of early detection and management of hypertensionanddiabetes and therefore are closelylinked to major noncommunicablediseases. Other modifiable riskfactors Four main shared risk factors – tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol –are the most importantin the sphere ofnoncommunicable diseases. Exposure to environmental and occupational hazards, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, with fumes from solid fuels, ozone, airborne dust and allergens may cause chronic respiratory disease and some air pollution sources including fumes from solid fuels may cause lung cancer, indoor and outdoor air pollution, heat waves and chronic stress related to work and unemployment are also associated with cardiovascular diseases. Exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos, diesel exhaust gases and ionizing and ultraviolet radiation in the living and working environment can increase the risk of cancer. Similarly, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals in agriculture and discharge of toxic products fromunregulated chemicalindustries may cause cancer and other noncommunicable diseases such as kidney disease. These exposures have their greatest potential to influence noncommunicable diseases earlyin life, and thus special attention must be paid to preventing exposure duringpregnancy and childhood. Simple, affordable interventions to reduce environmental and occupational health risks are available, andprioritization andimplementation of these interventions can contribute to reducing the burden due to noncommunicable diseases (Health Assembly resolutions WHA49.12 on WHO global strategy for occupational health for all, WHA58.22 on cancer prevention and control, WHA60.26 on workers’ health –globalplanofaction, andWHA61.19 onclimatechange andhealth). Mental disorders As mental disorders are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the global burden of noncommunicable diseases, equitable access to effective programmes and health care interventions is needed. Mental disorders affect, and are affected by, other noncommunicable diseases: they can be a precursor or consequence of a noncommunicable disease, or the result of interactive effects. For example, there is evidence that depression predisposes people to heart attacks and, conversely, heart attacks increase the likelihood of depression. Risk factors of noncommunicable diseases such as sedentary behaviour and harmful use of alcohol also link noncommunicable diseases with mental disorders. Close connections with characteristics of economically underprivileged population segments such as lower educational level, lower socioeconomic status, stress and unemployment are shared by mental disorders and noncommunicable diseases. Despite these strong connections, evidence indicates that mental disorders in patients with noncommunicable diseases as well as noncommunicable diseases in patients with mentaldisorders are often overlooked. The comprehensive mental health action plan needs to be implemented in close coordination with the action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases,at alllevels. Communicable diseases The role ofinfectious agents in the pathogenesis of noncommunicable diseases, either on their own or in combination with genetic and environmental influences, has been increasingly recognized in recent years. Many noncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease are linked to communicable diseases in either aetiology or susceptibility to severe outcomes. Increasingly cancers, including some withglobalimpact such as cancer of the cervix, liver, oral cavity and stomach, have been shown to have an infectious aetiology. In developing countries, infections are known to be the cause of about one fifth of cancers. High rates of other cancers in developing countries that are linked to infections or infestations include herpes virus andHIV, in Kaposi sarcoma, and liver flukes, in cholangiocarcinoma. Some significant disabilities such as blindness, deafness, cardiac defects and intellectual impairment can derive from preventable infectious causes. Strong population-based services to control infectious diseases through prevention, including immunization (e.g. vaccines against hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, measles, rubella, influenza, pertussis, and poliomyelitis), diagnosis, treatment and control strategies will reduce both the burden and the impact of noncommunicable diseases. There is also ahigh risk ofinfectious disease acquisition and susceptibilityin people withpre-existing noncommunicable diseases. Attention to this interaction would maximize the opportunities to detect and to treat both noncommunicable andinfectious diseases through alert primary and more specialized health care services. For example, tobacco smokers and people with diabetes, alcohol-use disorders, immunosuppression or exposure to second-hand smoke have a higher risk of developing tuberculosis. As the diagnosis of tuberculosis is often missed in people with chronic respiratory diseases, collaboration in screening for diabetes and chronic respiratory disease in tuberculosis clinics and for tuberculosis in noncommunicable disease clinics could enhance case-finding. Likewise, integrating noncommunicablediseaseprogrammesorpalliativecarewithHIVcareprogrammeswouldbringmutual benefits since both cater to long-term care and support as a part of the programme and also because noncommunicablediseasescanbeaside-effectoflong-termtreatmentofHIVinfectionandAIDS. Demographic change and disabilities The prevention of noncommunicable diseases will increase the number and proportion of people who age healthily and avoid high health care costs and even higher indirect costs in older age groups. About 15% of the population experiences disability, and the increase in noncommunicable diseases is having a profound effect on disability trends; for example, these diseases are estimated to account for about two thirds of all years lived with disability in low-income and middle-income countries. Noncommunicable-disease-related disability (such as amputation, blindness or paralysis) puts significant demands on social welfare and health systems, lowers productivity and impoverishes families. Rehabilitation needs to be acentralhealth strategyin noncommunicable disease programmes in order to address risk factors (e.g. obesity and physical inactivity), as well as loss of function due to noncommunicable diseases (e.g. amputation and blindness due to diabetes or stroke). Access to rehabilitation services can decrease the effects and consequences of disease, hasten discharge from hospital, slow orhalt deteriorationin healthandimprove qualityoflife. Violence and unintentional injuries Exposure to child maltreatment (which includes physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and neglect or deprivation), is a recognized risk factor for the subsequent adoption of high-risk behaviours such as smoking, harmful use of alcohol, drug abuse, and eating disorders, which in turn predispose individuals to noncommunicable diseases. There is evidence that ischaemic heart disease, cancer and chronic lung disease are related to experiences of abuse during childhood. Similarly, experiencing intimate partner violence has been associated with harmful use of alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, and eating disorders. Programmes to prevent child maltreatment and intimate partner violence can therefore make a significant contribution to the prevention of noncommunicable diseases by reducing thelikelihoodoftobacco use, unhealthydiet, andharmful use of alcohol. The lack of safe infrastructure for people to walk and cycle is an inhibitor for physical exercise. Therefore, well-known road traffic injury prevention strategies such as appropriate road safety legislation and enforcement, as well as good land use planning and infrastructure supporting safe walking and cycling, can contribute to the prevention of noncommunicable diseases as well as help address injuries. Impairment by alcohol is an important factor influencing both the risks and the severity of all unintentional injuries. These include road traffic accidents, falls, drowning, burns and allforms of violence. Therefore, addressingharmful use of alcohol willbe beneficialfor prevention of noncommunicable diseasesas well as injuries. Appendix 2 Comprehensive global monitoring framework, including 25 indicators, and a set of nine voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases Framework element  Target  Indicator  Mortality and morbidity  Prematuremortalityfrom noncommunicabledisease  (1) A25% relativereduction intheoverall mortalityfrom cardiovasculardiseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratorydiseases  (1) Unconditionalprobabilityof dyingbetween ages of 30 and 70 fromcardiovascular diseases, cancer,diabetes or chronic respiratorydiseases  Additionalindicator  (2) Cancer incidence,bytypeof cancer, per 100000 population  Risk factors  Behaviouralriskfactors  Harmfuluseof alcohol1  (2) At least 10%relativereductioninthe harmfuluseof alcohol,2 as appropriate, within thenationalcontext  (3) Total(recorded andunrecorded) alcoholper capita (aged 15+ years old) consumptionwithina calendar year in litres of purealcohol, asappropriate, within the nationalcontext (4) Age-standardized prevalenceof heavyepisodic drinkingamongadolescentsandadults, asappropriate, within thenationalcontext (5) Alcohol-related morbidityand mortalityamong adolescents and adults,asappropriate,withinthe nationalcontext  Physicalinactivity  (3) A10% relativereduction inprevalenceof insufficientphysicalactivity  (6) Prevalenceof insufficientlyphysicallyactive adolescents,definedasless than60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensityactivitydaily (7) Age-standardized prevalenceof insufficiently physicallyactivepersonsaged 18+years (definedasless than150 minutes of moderate-intensityactivityper week, or equivalent)  Salt/sodiumintake  (4) A30% relativereduction inmeanpopulation 3intakeof salt/sodium (8) Age-standardized meanpopulation intakeof salt (sodiumchloride) per dayin gramsinpersons aged18+ years  Tobaccouse  (5) A30% relativereduction inprevalenceof currenttobaccouseinpersonsaged 15+ years  (9) Prevalenceof current tobaccouseamongadolescents (10) Age-standardized prevalenceof currenttobaccouse amongpersons aged18+ years  Biologicalrisk factors  Raised blood pressure  (6) A25% relativereduction in theprevalence of raised blood pressureor containthe prevalenceof raised bloodpressure, according to nationalcircumstances  (11) Age-standardized prevalenceof raisedblood pressureamongpersons aged18+ years (definedas systolic bloodpressureQ140 mmHgand/or diastolic blood pressureQ90 mmHg) andmeansystolic blood pressure  Diabetes and obesity4  (7) Halttheriseindiabetes andobesity  (12) Age-standardized prevalenceof raisedblood glucose/diabetes amongpersonsaged18+ years (defined as fastingplasma glucoseconcentration Q7.0mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or on medication for raisedblood glucose) (13) Prevalenceof overweight and obesityin adolescents (definedaccordingtotheWHO growth referencefor school-aged childrenandadolescents,overweight –one standarddeviationbodymass indexfor ageandsex, and  1Countries willselect indicator(s) ofharmfuluseas appropriatetonationalcontext andin linewithWHO’s globalstrategyto reducetheharmfuluseof alcoholandthatmayincludeprevalenceofheavyepisodicdrinking,totalalcoholper capitaconsumption, and alcohol-related morbidityand mortality, amongothers. 2In WHO’s globalstrategytoreducetheharmfuluseof alcoholtheconceptof theharmfuluseof alcoholencompasses thedrinking thatcauses detrimentalhealth and socialconsequences for thedrinker,thepeoplearoundthedrinker and societyat large, as wellas the patterns ofdrinkingthat areassociated withincreased risk of adversehealth outcomes. 3WHO’s recommendationis less than5grams of salt or 2grams of sodiumper person perday. 4Countries willselect indicator(s) appropriatetonationalcontext. Framework element  Target  Indicator  obese– two standarddeviationsbodymass indexfor age and sex) (14) Age-standardized prevalenceof overweight and obesityinpersons aged18+ years (definedasbodymass index Q25kg/m. for overweight andbodymass indexQ 30 kg/m. for obesity)  Additionalindicators  (15) Age-standardized meanproportion of totalenergy intakefrom saturated fattyacidsinpersons aged18+ 1 years (16) Age-standardized prevalenceof persons (aged18+ years) consumingless than fivetotalservings (400 grams) of fruitandvegetables per day (17) Age-standardized prevalenceof raisedtotal cholesterolamongpersonsaged 18+years (defined as totalcholesterolQ5.0 mmol/lor 190mg/dl);
