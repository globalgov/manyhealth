 SEVENTY-SECOND WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA72.6 Agenda item 12.5 28 May 2019 Global action on patient safety  The Seventy-second World Health Assembly, Having considered the report by the Director-General on global action on patient safety;1 1 Document A72/26. Recalling resolution WHA55.18 (2002), which urged Member States to “pay the closest possible attention to the problem of patient safety; and to establish and strengthen science-based systems, necessary for improving patients’ safety and the quality of health care”; recognizing that patient safety is a critical element of, and the foundation for, delivering quality health care; and welcoming the inclusion of the need for patient safety in the Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019–2023; Recognizing that patient safety cannot be ensured without access to: safe infrastructure, technologies and medical devices, and their safe use by patients, who need to be well informed; and a skilled and committed health workforce, in an enabling and safe environment; Noting that patient safety builds on quality, basic and continued education and training of health professionals that ensures that they have the adequate professional skills and competencies in their respective roles and functions; Recognizing that access to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and other commodities, and their correct administration and use, also contribute to patient safety; Noting further the importance of hygiene for patient safety and the prevention of health care-associated infections, and for reducing antimicrobial resistance; Noting that ensuring patient safety is a key priority in providing quality health services and considering that all individuals should receive safe health services, regardless of where they are delivered; Reaffirming the principle of “First do no harm” and recognizing the benefits to be gained and the need to promote and improve patient safety across health systems at all levels, sectors and settings relevant to physical and mental health, especially at the level of primary health care, but also including, for example, emergency care, community care, rehabilitation and ambulatory care; Recognizing that the safety of patients during the provision of health services that are safe and of high quality is a prerequisite for strengthening health care systems and making progress towards effective universal health coverage under Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote health and well-being for all at all ages);  Acknowledging that instilling a safety culture, a patient-centred approach, and improving and ensuring patient safety require capacity-building, strong leadership, systemic and systematic approaches, adequate human and other resources, robust data, sharing of best practices, mutual learning, trust and accountability, which can be strengthened, as appropriate, by international cooperation and collaboration; Recognizing that improving and ensuring patient safety is a growing challenge to health service delivery globally and that unsafe health care causes a significant level of avoidable patient harm and human suffering, places a considerable strain on health system finances and leads to a loss of trust in health systems;  Concerned that the burden of injuries and other harm to patients from adverse events is likely one of the top 10 causes of death and disability in the world, comparable to that of tuberculosis and malaria, and that available evidence suggests that most of this burden falls on low- and middle-income countries, where 134 million health care-associated adverse events occur annually in hospitals, due to unsafe care, contributing to 2.6 million deaths;  Recognizing that most adverse events can potentially be avoided with effective prevention and mitigation strategies, including, as appropriate, improved policies, data systems, redesigned processes of care (including addressing human factors, including training), environmental hygiene and infrastructure, better organizational culture to improve practices, supportive and effective regulatory systems and improved communication strategies, and that solutions can often be simple and inexpensive, with the value of prevention outweighing the cost of care; Recognizing the success, pioneering work and dedication of governments in many Member States in developing strategies and policies to support and improve patient safety, and in implementing safety and quality programmes, initiatives and interventions, such as insurance arrangements, patient ombudspersons, creating a patient safety culture throughout the health system, transparent incident reporting systems that allow learning from mistakes, and no-fault and no-blame handling of adverse events and their consequences; and a patient-centred approach to patient safety; Concerned at the lack of overall progress in improving the safety of health care and that, despite global efforts to reduce the burden of patient harm, the overall situation over the past 17 years indicates that significant improvement can be made and that safety measures – even those implemented in high-income settings – have had limited or varying impact, and that most have not been adapted for successful application in low- and middle-income countries;  Recognizing the importance of robust patient safety measurement to promote more resilient health systems, better and more focused preventive work to promote safety and risk awareness, transparent incident reporting, data analysis and learning systems, at all levels, alongside education, training and continuous professional development to build and maintain a competent, compassionate and committed health care workforce operating within a supportive environment to make health care safe, and the importance of engaging and empowering patients and families in improving the safety of care for better health outcomes;  Recognizing also that improving and ensuring patient safety calls for addressing the gaps in knowledge, policy, design, delivery and communication at all levels,  1. ENDORSES the establishment of World Patient Safety Day, to be marked annually on 17 September in order to increase public awareness and engagement, enhance global understanding, and work towards global solidarity and action by Member States to promote patient safety; 2.
