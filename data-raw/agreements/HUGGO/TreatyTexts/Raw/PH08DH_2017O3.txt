 SEVENTIETH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY  A70/27  Provisional agenda item 15.1  18 May 2017  Preparation for the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases, to be held in 2018 Report by the Director-General 1. This report is submitted in response to Health Assembly resolution WHA69.6 (2016) and provides an update on the preparation for the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases, to be held in 2018, including the responses to specific assignments given to the Secretariat. 2. In January 2017, the Executive Board, at its 140th session, noted an earlier version of this report1 and adopted resolution EB140.R7, which it recommended to the Health Assembly for adoption. Since then, the report has been updated to take account of mortality estimates for 2015 and other recent developments. Annex 1 has been brought into line with the outcomes of WHO-CHOICE modelling. 1 See document EB140/27 and the summary records of the Executive Board at its 140th session, fifteenth meeting, section 1. 2 Data available at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/index1.html (accessed 2 May 2017). NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES: CURRENT SITUATION 3. WHO estimates that in 2015, 15.0 million people between the ages of 30 and 69 died from noncommunicable diseases, as shown below:2   Men  Women  Total  Percentage  Low-income countries  0.4 million  0.4 million  0.9 million  6%  Lower middle-income countries  3.6 million  2.6 million  6.1 million  41%  Upper middle-income countries  3.5 million  2.4 million  5.8 million  39%  High-income countries  1.4 million  0.8 million  2.2 million  15%  Total  8.9 million  6.2 million  15.0 million  100%     Men  Women  Total  Percentage  African Region  0.7 million  0.6 million  1.3 million  9%  Region of the Americas  1.1 million  0.8 million  1.9 million  13%  Eastern Mediterranean Region  0.6 million  0.5 million  1.0 million  7%  European Region  1.5 million  0.8 million  2.4 million  16%  South-East Asian Region  2.6 million  1.8 million  4.4 million  29%  Western Pacific Region  2.4 million  1.6 million  4.0 million  27%  Total  8.9 million  6.2 million  15.0 million  100%  4. Over 80% of these premature deaths, which occurred in people between the ages of 30 and 69, were the result of the four main noncommunicable diseases: cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. 5. Globally, premature mortality from these four main noncommunicable diseases declined by 15% between 2000 and 2012. This rate of decline is insufficient to meet target 3.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals (by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being). 6. In 2015, 138 Member States had shown very poor or no progress towards implementing the four time-bound national commitments for 2015 and 2016 set out in the Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.1,2 The attainment of those commitments by Member States is currently being assessed3 using the indicators set out in WHO’s technical note dated 1 May 2015.4 It appears that the pace of progress in 2015 and 2016 has been insufficient. 7. Although the number of countries which have an operational national noncommunicable disease policy with a budget for implementation increased from 32% in 2010 to 50% in 2013,5 many countries, in particular developing countries, continue to struggle to move from commitment to action. The main obstacles include: a lack of policy expertise to integrate measures to address noncommunicable diseases into national responses to the Sustainable Development Goals; unmet demands for technical assistance to be provided through bilateral and multilateral channels to strengthen national capacity, which would enable countries to develop their national multisectoral noncommunicable disease responses; a change in patterns of health financing (where more of the burden is placed on domestic budgets); insufficient analytical, legal and tax administrative capacity to 1 See paragraphs 16–18 of document A69/10, based on data included in the Noncommunicable diseases progress monitor 2015, available at http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd-progress-monitor-2015/en/ (accessed 10 October 2016). 2 Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 68/300 (2014).

In paragraph 3(10) of resolution WHA66.10 (2013), the Director-General was requested to propose an update of Appendix 3 to the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, in the light of new scientific evidence. Accordingly, an initial expert group meeting was held to advise the Secretariat on an appropriate methodology and a review of evidence was conducted in 2015.7 11. In paragraph 5(1) of resolution WHA69.6, the Director-General was requested to submit a draft updated Appendix 3, through the Executive Board, to the Seventieth World Health Assembly, in 2017, in accordance with the timeline contained in Annex 2 to document A69/10. 12. In response to these resolutions, in May 2016 the Secretariat announced to the permanent missions in Geneva the process that the Secretariat is following to update Appendix 3. The process has included: a second expert group meeting (27 and 28 June 2016);1 a web-based consultation on a WHO discussion paper dated 25 July 2016 on the draft updated Appendix 3 (25 July–1 September 2016); an informal consultation of Member States (24 August 2016); and an informal hearing with non-State actors (25 August 2016). The process and its outcomes to date are described on WHO’s website.2 13. Taking into account the feedback received during the process to date, the Secretariat has prepared a draft updated Appendix 3 for consideration by Member States, which is set out in Annex 1 to the present document. In revising the Annex since its presentation to the Executive Board in document EB140/27, the menu of policy options to reduce tobacco use has been updated to take into account up-to-date scientific knowledge, available evidence and a review of international experience. 14. The Secretariat convened an information session on 24 April 2017 to provide Member States with: additional information to explain the underlying analysis related to interventions included in Appendix 3; and additional technical briefings on the evidence underpinning the inventions presented in Appendix 3.2 1 See http://www.who.int/nmh/events/appendix3-2nd-technical-meeting-report-25july2016.pdf?ua=1 (accessed 3 May 2017). 2 See http://www.who.int/ncds/governance/appendix3-update/en/ (accessed 3 May 2017). 3 Paragraph 37 of United Nations General Assembly resolution 68/300 refers to “the private sector, philanthropic entities and civil society”. However, for the purpose of discussions at the World Health Assembly, it is assumed that all non-State actors identified in paragraph 8 of WHO’s Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors are included in the scope of this approach (i.e. nongovernmental organizations, private sector entities, philanthropic foundations and academic institutions). 4 Document A69/10, Annex 4. Draft approach that can be used to register and publish contributions of non-State actors to the achievement of the nine voluntary targets for noncommunicable diseases3 15. In paragraph 37 of the 2014 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, the General Assembly called upon WHO, in consultation with Member States, in the context of the comprehensive global coordination mechanism for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, while ensuring appropriate protection from vested interests, to develop, before the end of 2015, an approach that can be used to register and publish contributions of the private sector, philanthropic entities and civil society to the achievement of the nine voluntary targets for noncommunicable diseases. 16. In response to this resolution, the Secretariat submitted a report to the Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly on the development of such an approach,4 outlining a conceptual framework that the Secretariat proposed to explore in 2016. The report also proposed an initial set of overarching principles and a preliminary analysis of potential risks. Member States adopted resolution WHA69.6, endorsing the process to further develop the approach in 2016 and requesting the Director-General to submit a report setting out the approach, through the Executive Board, to the Seventieth World Health Assembly, in 2017, in accordance with the timeline contained in Annex 4 to document A69/10. 17. In response to resolution WHA69.6, in September 2016 the Secretariat announced to the permanent missions in Geneva the process that the Secretariat is following to finalize its work on the development of the approach. The process is described on WHO’s website1 and has included a web-based consultation on a WHO discussion paper dated 26 September 2016 setting out a draft approach (26 September–14 October 2016). The feedback received through the web-based consultation has been given due consideration by the Secretariat and is reflected in the revised draft approach as set out in Annex 2 to the present document, which remains a work in progress.  1 See http://www.who.int/ncds/governance/measure-non-state-contribution/en/ (accessed 3 May 2017). 2 Document A67/14 Add.1, Annex, Appendix 1. 3 See resolution WHA66.10 (2013). 4 Document EB138/2016/REC/1, Annex 3. 5 Document A68/11, Annex 3, Appendix 2. Proposed workplan for the global coordination mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases covering the period 2018–2019 18. In paragraph 15 of the terms of reference for the global coordination mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases,2 the Director-General is requested to submit draft workplans for the global coordination mechanism to the Health Assembly, through the Executive Board, setting out the activities of the global coordination mechanism. 19. In response to this request, the Secretariat has prepared a proposed workplan for the global coordination mechanism, covering the period 2018–2019, for consideration by Member States, which is set out in Annex 3 to the present document. EVALUATIONS 20. In accordance with paragraph 60 of the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020,3 and in conformity with the evaluation workplan for 2016–2017,4 the Secretariat will convene a representative group of stakeholders, including Member States and international partners, that will work from the beginning of the second quarter of 2017 to the end of third quarter of 2017, in order to conduct a mid-point evaluation of progress on the implementation of the global action plan. The results will be reported to the Seventy-first Health Assembly, through the Executive Board. 21. In accordance with the modalities of the preliminary evaluation of the global coordination mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases,5 paragraph 19 of the terms of reference for the global coordination mechanism, and the evaluation workplan for 2016–2017, the Health Assembly will conduct a preliminary evaluation of the global coordination mechanism between May 2017 and January 2018, in order to assess its results and its added value. The results will be reported to the Seventy-first Health Assembly, through the Executive Board. PREPARATORY PROCESS LEADING TO THE THIRD HIGH-LEVEL MEETING OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, TO BE HELD IN 2018 22. In response to paragraph 38 of the 2014 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, in September 2017 the Director-General will submit to the United Nations General Assembly a report on the progress achieved in the implementation of the Outcome document and of the 2011 Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases,1 in preparation for a comprehensive review by the General Assembly, in 2018, of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. The contours of the report are described in Annex 7 to document A69/10. 23. As in the preparation for the first High-level Meeting of the General Assembly, in 2011, the Secretariat will hold global and regional multisectoral informal consultations of Member States between October 2017 and May 2018, as appropriate, which will serve to provide inputs to the preparation for the third High-level Meeting, as well as to the meeting itself. The results of these informal consultations will be reported to the Seventy-first Health Assembly, through the Executive Board. 24. The President of Uruguay will host the WHO Global Conference on Noncommunicable Diseases: enhancing policy coherence between different spheres of policy-making that have a bearing on attaining SDG target 3.4 on NCDs by 2030, which will take place from 18 to 20 October 2017 in Montevideo.2 The mandate for the conference derives from action 1.3 of the workplan of the WHO Global Coordination Mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases covering the period 2016–2017,3 and the preparatory process for the third High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Non-communicable Diseases, which will be held in 2018. The Global Conference is expected to result in a concise outcome document, to be endorsed by the conference participants, setting out a roadmap that Member States may consider implementing to attain SDG target 3.4.  1 Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 66/2 (2011). 2 More information will be posted at http://www.who.int/montevideo2017. 3 See Annex 3 of document A68/11. ACTION BY THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY 25. The Health Assembly is invited to note the report and to adopt the draft resolution recommended by the Executive Board in resolution EB140.R7. ANNEX 1 DRAFT UPDATED APPENDIX 3 TO THE GLOBAL ACTION PLAN FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES 2013–2020 What is Appendix 3? 1. Appendix 3 is a part of the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020. It consists of a menu of policy options and cost-effective interventions to assist Member States in implementing, as appropriate for national context (without prejudice to the sovereign rights of nations to determine taxation among other policies), actions to achieve the nine voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. They are presented under the six objectives of the global action plan. The list of interventions is not exhaustive but is intended to provide information and guidance on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-based and individual interventions based on current evidence, and to serve as the basis for future work to develop and expand the evidence base. Countries are implementing the global action plan, as appropriate for the national context, and Appendix 3 has been used in the development and prioritization of national action plans.  Why update Appendix 3? 2. Appendix 3 has been updated at the request of Member States, to take into consideration the emergence of new evidence of cost-effectiveness and the issuance of new WHO recommendations since the adoption of the global action plan in 2013, and also to refine the existing formulation of some interventions based on lessons learned from the use of the first version. The global action plan ends in 2020, and any future updates will be considered as part of the development of any subsequent global strategies for noncommunicable diseases. What has changed? 3. The menu of options listed for objectives 1 (raising the priority accorded to noncommunicable diseases), 2 (strengthening leadership and governance), 5 (research) and 6 (monitoring and evaluation) are process-related recommendations and have not changed. Within objectives 3 (risk factors) and 4 (health systems), in the updated Appendix 3, there are now a total of 86 interventions and overarching/enabling actions, representing an expansion from the original list of 62. This increase is due to the greater availability of scientific evidence and to the need to disaggregate some previous interventions (such as “reduce salt intake”) into more clearly defined and implementable actions. 4. As in the original Appendix 3, a select number of interventions, considered to be the most cost-effective and feasible for implementation, are identified in bold text. In the updated Appendix 3, 16 interventions are listed in bold,1 as compared to 14 in the original version, and the method for 1 With an average cost-effectiveness ratio of ≤I$ 100/disability-adjusted life-year averted in low and lower-middle income countries. The international dollar (I$) is a hypothetical unit of currency that has the same purchasing power parity that the United States dollar had in the United States at a given point in time. identifying such interventions has been modified.1 Other interventions, for which cost-effectiveness analysis by the WHO’s Choosing interventions that are cost-effective (WHO-CHOICE) project could be completed, are listed in descending order of cost-effectiveness.2 Interventions that are mentioned in WHO’s guidelines and technical documents where WHO-CHOICE analysis has not been able to be conducted are also listed. Care needs to be taken when interpreting these lists; for example, the absence of WHO-CHOICE analysis does not necessarily mean that an intervention is not cost-effective, affordable or feasible – rather, there were methodological or capacity reasons for which the WHO-CHOICE analysis could not be completed. The economic analyses in the technical annex,3 upon which this list is based, give an assessment of cost-effectiveness ratio, health impact and the economic cost of implementation. These economic results present a set of parameters for consideration by Member States, but it must be emphasized that such global analyses should be accompanied by analyses in the local context. Other WHO tools, such as the OneHealth Tool,4 are available to help individual countries cost specific interventions in their national context. 1 The listing of interventions in bold text in this updated Appendix 3 is based on economic analyses only. Critical non-financial considerations that may affect the feasibility of certain interventions in some settings are set out in a new column in the updated Appendix 3.  2 Based on cost-effectiveness ratio in low and middle income settings. 3 The draft technical annex is available in the WHO discussion paper dated 25 July 2016 on the draft updated Appendix 3, and information on the process to update the Appendix, are available at: http://who.int/ncds/governance/appendix3-update-discussion-paper/en/ (accessed 3 May 2017).  4 http://www.who.int/choice/onehealthtool/en/ (accessed 3 May 2017). 5 See for example: http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/247638/obesity-090514.pdf; http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/247640/tobacco-090514.pdf?ua=1; and http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/247629/Alcohol-and-Inequities.pdf (accessed 3 May 2017). The importance of non-financial considerations 5. Cost-effectiveness analysis is a useful tool but it has limitations and should not be used as the sole basis for decision-making. When selecting interventions for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, consideration should be given to effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, affordability, implementation capacity, feasibility, according to national circumstances, and impact on health equity of interventions, and to the need to implement a combination of population-wide policy interventions and individual interventions. 6. Critical non-financial considerations that may affect the feasibility of certain interventions in some settings are set out in a new column in the updated Appendix 3. Many of the interventions for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases involve multisectoral benefits and costs that need to be taken into account, and examples of the multisectoral aspects of these interventions are outlined in Appendix 5 to the global action plan. It was not possible to provide an equity rating for each intervention, given the importance of context, but, in general, population-based interventions, including fiscal policies and environmental changes, show the most potential to reduce inequalities in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases.5 Individual interventions, especially those involving education and awareness campaigns, are most likely to widen inequalities and should be accompanied by measures to assess and address other barriers to behaviour change. For any intervention, the impact on health inequalities needs to be considered and evaluated, in order to ensure that policies are effective across all population groups.intervention, the impact on health inequalities needs to be considered and evaluated, in order to ensure that policies are effective across all population groups.intervention, the impact on health inequalities needs to be considered and evaluated, in order to ensure that policies are effective across all population groups.1 For example, accompanying tobacco price increases with smoking cessation support for the poor, and ensuring food product reformulation involves the entire product range and not just the more expensive options. 2 The draft technical annex is available in the WHO discussion paper dated 25 July 2016 on the draft updated Appendix 3, which is available at http://who.int/ncds/governance/appendix3-update/en/ (accessed 10 October 2016). It will be updated after the 140th session of the Executive Board, before the Seventieth World Health Assembly. Technical annex 7. Based on feedback from experts and Member States, this updated Appendix 3 is accompanied by a technical annex.2 The annex provides more detailed information about the methodology used to identify and analyse interventions, and presents the results of the economic analysis separately for low and lower-middle income, and upper-middle and high income countries. The Secretariat will explore options to provide an interactive web-tool, to enable users to compare and rank the information according to their own needs. The detailed description of the WHO-CHOICE methods for these analyses, including the assumptions, strength of evidence and the individual studies used to inform the development of models for each intervention, will be published separately as peer-reviewed scientific papers, which will be publicly available through open access. Menu of policy options  Critical non-financial considerationsa

In paragraph 37 of the 2014 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,1 the General Assembly called upon WHO, in consultation with Member States, “in the context of the comprehensive global coordination mechanism for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, while ensuring appropriate protection from vested interests, to develop before the end of 2015, an approach that can be used to register and publish contributions of the private sector, philanthropic entities and civil society to the achievement of the nine voluntary targets for non-communicable diseases”. 2. In response to this resolution, the Secretariat submitted a report to the Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly on the development of such an approach,2 outlining a conceptual framework that the Secretariat proposed to explore in 2016. The report also proposed an initial set of overarching principles and a preliminary analysis of potential risks. 3. Member States adopted resolution WHA69.6 (2016), endorsing the process to further develop the approach in 2016 and requesting the Director-General to submit a report setting out the approach, through the Executive Board, to the Seventieth World Health Assembly, in 2017, in accordance with the timeline contained in Annex 4 to document A69/10. 4. In response to resolution WHA69.6, the Secretariat prepared a WHO discussion paper (version dated 26 September 2016)3 setting out a draft approach, including a set of proposed output indicators, which was submitted for comments from Member States and non-State actors, through a web-based consultation, from 26 September 2016 to 14 October 2016. The Secretariat received comments from four Member States and two non-State actors. The feedback received has been given due consideration in developing the draft approach set out in the present document, which remains a work in progress. 1 Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 68/300 (2014). See http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/300 (accessed 2 May 2017). 2 Document A69/10, Annex 4. 3 See http://www.who.int/ncds/governance/measure-non-state-contribution/en/ (accessed 4 November 2016). 4 Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 66/2 (2011). CONTEXT 5. In paragraph 37 of the 2011 Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable diseases,4 the General Assembly acknowledged “the contribution of and important role played by all relevant stakeholders, including individuals, families and communities, intergovernmental organizations and religious institutions, civil society, academia, the media, voluntary associations and, where and as appropriate, the private sector and industry, in support of national efforts for noncommunicable disease prevention and control”, and recognized “the need to further support the strengthening of coordination among these stakeholders in order to improve the effectiveness of these efforts”. 6. In addition, in paragraph 44 of the Political Declaration, the General Assembly called upon the private sector, with a view to strengthening its contribution to noncommunicable disease prevention and control, to: (a) take measures to implement the WHO’s set of recommendations to reduce the impact of the marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children; (b) consider producing and promoting more food products consistent with a healthy diet; (c) promote and create an enabling environment for healthy behaviours among workers; (d) work towards reducing the use of salt in the food industry; and (e) contribute to efforts to improve access to and affordability of medicines and technologies in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. 7. In paragraph 26 of the 2014 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,1 the General Assembly acknowledged that limited progress has been made in implementing paragraph 44 of the Political Declaration, and “although an increased number of private sector entities have started to produce and promote food products consistent with a healthy diet, such products are not always broadly affordable and available in all communities within countries”. 8. Although a global accountability framework on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases has been established for Member States,2 no agreed set of predefined indicators exists to encourage non-State actors to register and publish their own contributions to the achievement of the nine voluntary targets for noncommunicable diseases in the most objective and independently verifiable manner. 1 Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 68/300 (2014). 2 Summarized in Annex 8 to document A69/10. SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE DRAFT APPROACH 9. In Annex 4 to document A69/10, the Secretariat highlighted some considerations to be taken into account when developing the approach, including alignment, impact and participation criteria and methodological options. Accordingly, the approach will consist of (a) a self-reporting tool for non-State actors and (b) a platform to publish the use of the tool by non-State actors. 10. In 2013, Member States adopted the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, which provides a comprehensive set of policy options for Member States and proposed actions for international partners and the private sector. The implementation of the global action plan would accelerate progress towards the achievement of the nine voluntary global targets by 2025 and provide the impetus for the attainment of noncommunicable disease-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. 11. The Secretariat considers that the actions for international partners as reflected in the global action plan are the cornerstone for developing an approach that ensures coordination among non-State actors and alignment with WHO’s technical support to Member States. Although the global action plan is time-bound, its objectives remain relevant for addressing noncommunicable diseases and reaching the noncommunicable disease-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. 12. The six objectives of the global action plan are mutually reinforcing and it is likely that a non-State actor’s activities may cover more than one objective. However, non-State actors are encouraged to register only those contributions related to activities within their core area of business, as defined in their strategy documents, that have the highest impact in reducing the burden of noncommunicable diseases. 13. The Secretariat does not have the capacity to quality assure all activities by non-State actors. The purpose of the draft approach is therefore to allow the Secretariat to give further guidance on the contributions that non-State actors can make to help accelerate the achievement of the nine targets, including a set of proposed output indicators for the different categories of non-State actors, and to enable aggregate reporting on the level of these activities by non-State actors to the Health Assembly. PARTICIPATION  14. Given the multiplicity of actors currently working to advance the fight against noncommunicable diseases, and the wide range of activities engaged in, the participation of non-State actors in the implementation of the approach will serve a meaningful purpose only if the participation criteria are selective. 15. In paragraph 38 of the 2011 Political Declaration, the General Assembly recognized the fundamental conflict of interest between the tobacco industry and public health. This irreconcilable conflict is recognized in the guidelines for implementation of Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which stress the inherent contradiction between the tobacco industry and social responsibility. Accordingly, the tobacco industry is excluded from participation. The arms industry is also excluded. 16. Overall eligibility for participation in the implementation of the approach is based on compliance by non-State actors with the provisions of United Nations General Assembly resolutions 66/2 (2011) and 68/300 (2014), WHO’s framework of engagement with non-State actors1 and the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020.2 1 Adopted by the Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly in resolution WHA69.10 (2016). 2 Endorsed by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly in resolution WHA66.10 (2013). Proposed Platform to publish the use of the approach 17. The global coordination mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases will promote the use of the approach by non-State actors. When endorsed by the Health Assembly, however, the approach will be a self-reporting method. It is proposed that the process of publishing the use of the self-reporting tool would entail detailed guidelines from the Secretariat on ways in which non-State actors can contribute to the achievement of the nine voluntary global targets, including the development of quality criteria and quantifiable output indicators against which the achievement of the six agreed objectives of the global action plan can be measured. The process would also entail self-publishing by non-State actors of their contributions on their own websites, using the guidelines developed by the Secretariat. 18. To develop the approach – consisting of a self-reporting tool for non-State actors and a platform to publish the use of the self-reporting tool by non-State actors – further, the Secretariat is seeking guidance from Member States on the level of ambition that is required from the Secretariat in order to: – develop a concrete self-reporting tool for non-State actors, including related indicators; and – develop an open Internet platform which non-State actors could access in order to upload their own reports for broad comparison and assessment. ANNEX 3 PROPOSED WORKPLAN FOR THE GLOBAL COORDINATION MECHANISM ON THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES COVERING THE PERIOD 2018–2019 1. This workplan sets out the activities of the global coordination mechanism on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including those of time-bound Working Groups, covering the period 2018–2019. The workplan takes into account the terms of reference for the global coordination mechanism,1 the workplans covering the periods 2014–20152 and 2016–2017,3 the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020,4 the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases,5 the Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,6 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 2. This workplan takes into consideration the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the need to enhance multisectoral and multistakeholder advocacy, engagement and action that supports whole-of-government approaches across sectors beyond health and whole-of-society approaches engaging all sectors of society, in order to achieve the noncommunicable disease-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. 3.
