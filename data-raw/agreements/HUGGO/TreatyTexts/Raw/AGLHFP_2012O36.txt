attainable standard of physical and mental health, without distinction as to race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition, and the right of everyone to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one’s family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond one’s control,  Noting with particular concern that for millions of people, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including access to medicines, remains a distant goal, that especially for children and those living in poverty, the likelihood of achieving this goal is becoming increasingly remote, that millions of people are driven below the poverty line each year because of catastrophic out-of-pocket payments for health care, and that excessive out-of-pocket payments can discourage the impoverished from seeking or continuing care, Taking note of the World Health Report 2010, entitled “Health systems financing: the path to universal coverage”, and the Social Protection Floor Initiative endorsed by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in April 2009, and taking note with appreciation of the

tuberculosis, malaria and HIV and AIDS, as well as the causes of maternal and infant mortality, are associated with social and economic conditions, the improvement of which is a social and economic policy issue, Acknowledging also the need to continue to promote, establish or support and strengthen multisectoral national policies and plans for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and to take steps to implement such policies and plans, including by recognizing the importance of universal coverage in national health systems, taking into account their significant impact on the sustainability of health system financing, 6 Report of the International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo, 5–13 September 1994 (United Nations publication, Sales No.
